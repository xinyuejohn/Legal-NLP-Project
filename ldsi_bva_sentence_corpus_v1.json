The veteran's claimed in-service stressors have been \r\ncorroborated by service records.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran has a medical diagnosis of post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder based on his in-service stressors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPost-traumatic stress disorder was incurred in service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304 \r\n(2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board finds that each of the four content \r\nrequirements of a duty to assist notice has been fully \r\nsatisfied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b).  \r\nLetters from the RO dated in December 2001 and February 2005 \r\nprovided the veteran with an explanation of the type of \r\nevidence necessary to substantiate his claim, as well as an \r\nexplanation of what evidence was to be provided by him and \r\nwhat evidence the VA would attempt to obtain on his behalf.  \r\nSee generally Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 \r\n(2002).  In addition, the letters told the veteran to submit \r\nany additional evidence that he had in his possession.  The \r\nVA has no outstanding duty to inform the appellant that any \r\nadditional information or evidence is needed.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's initial VCAA letter was provided prior to the \r\nadjudication of his claim.  Although the record reflects that \r\nthe RO has not provided notice with respect to the initial-\r\ndisability-rating and effective-date elements of the claim, \r\nSee Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), those \r\nmatters are not currently before the Board and the RO will \r\nhave the opportunity to provide the required notice before \r\ndeciding those matters.\r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that all relevant facts have been \r\nproperly developed, and that all evidence necessary for \r\nequitable resolution of the issue has been obtained.  The \r\nveteran's service medical/personnel records and his post \r\nservice treatment records have been obtained.  In November \r\n2005, the veteran had a hearing before the undersigned acting \r\nVeterans Law Judge.  The Board does not know of any \r\nadditional relevant evidence which is available but has not \r\nbeen obtained.  For the foregoing reasons, the Board \r\nconcludes that all reasonable efforts were made by the VA to \r\nobtain evidence necessary to substantiate the veteran's \r\nclaim.  Therefore, no further assistance to the veteran with \r\nthe development of evidence is required.  \r\n\r\nDuring the hearing held in November 2005, the veteran \r\ntestified that shortly after he arrived in Vietnam, his unit \r\nstarted taking incoming fire.  He reportedly went to a \r\nbunker, but the bunker collapsed on top of him.  He also \r\nreported other stressors such as removing enemy bodies from \r\nthe wire fence surrounding the fire base and another incident \r\nin which fellow soldiers were wounded.  The veteran also \r\nreported that he sought treatment in 1995 and was diagnosed \r\nwith PTSD.   He reported that he had since been diagnosed \r\nwith PTSD on many occasions and was continuing to receive \r\ntreatment for the disorder from the VA.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability due to \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131.  Post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with Sec. 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, \r\nestablished by medical evidence, between current symptoms and \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor; and credible evidence that \r\nthe claimed in-service stressor actually occurred.  See 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f).  If the diagnosis of a mental disorder \r\ndoes not conform with DSM-IV or is not supported by the \r\nfindings on the examination report, the rating agency shall \r\nreturn the report to the examiner to substantiate the \r\ndiagnosis.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a).\r\n\r\nRegarding the requirement under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) that \r\nthere be medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder, the Board notes that the veteran \r\nhas been given a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nby VA health care providers on many occasions.  For example, \r\nnumerous individual and group therapy treatment records dated \r\nfrom 2000 and later contain diagnoses of PTSD.   \r\n\r\nRegarding the issue of whether there is credible evidence \r\nthat the veteran's claimed stressors actually occurred, the \r\nBoard notes that the veteran described his claimed stressors \r\nas including being in a bunker which collapsed.  The Board \r\nalso notes that the veteran's record of assignments reflects \r\nthat his principal duty at that time was combat construction \r\nspecialist.  The veteran's service medical records include an \r\nentry dated in November 1970 which shows that the veteran was \r\ntreated for blood spots in his eyes after he was injured when \r\na bunker fell in on him.  The Board notes that this is \r\nconsistent with the veteran's claimed stressor of having been \r\ninvolved in the incident described in his testimony.  Thus, \r\nthe occurrence of a stressor is adequately established.  \r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that a medical statement dated in \r\nDecember 2005 from a VA psychiatrist reflects that the \r\npsychiatrist has given an opinion demonstrating a nexus \r\nbetween the current PTSD and the stressors in service.  The \r\npsychiatrist stated that:\r\n\r\nMore likely that not, his chronic symptoms of PTSD \r\noriginated subsequent to a life threatening event \r\nwhich reportedly occurred on November 25, 1970, \r\nwhen the veteran's duty station, \"Fire base \r\nNancy,\" came under attack by hostile forces.  The \r\nveteran reportedly was trapped for some period of \r\ntime in a collapsed bunker and was apparently \r\nunconscious when he was rescued from said bunker.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the evidence shows that the veteran's claimed in-\r\nservice stressors have been corroborated by service records, \r\nand he also has a medical diagnosis of post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder based on those stressors.  Accordingly, the Board \r\nconcludes that the requirements for service connection for \r\nPTSD have been met and the appeal is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is \r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJ.

Lawson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from January 1945 to \r\nNovember 1946.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a rating determination of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nNew York, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran had a partial left hand index finger amputation \r\nin service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA left hand index finger amputation was incurred in wartime \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 \r\n(2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability arising from \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 \r\n(2006).  Service connection may be established for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence \r\nincluding that pertinent to service establishes that it was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records are not available, so \r\nthere is a heightened obligation to explain the findings and \r\nconclusions and to consider carefully the benefit-of-the-\r\ndoubt rule.  See O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, 367 \r\n(1991).  Although service medical records are not available, \r\nother forms of evidence of incurrence or aggravation of a \r\ndisease or injury in service are acceptable.  The following \r\nanalysis has been undertaken with the heightened duty in \r\nmind.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue in this case centers on whether the veteran's \r\ntestimony that he incurred a left index finger amputation in \r\nservice should be accepted.  He essentially indicates that \r\nhis left index finger was amputated, at its second joint, in \r\nservice in 1945.  He has submitted pictures to support his \r\nclaim, reporting that one is from before service, showing \r\nthat there is no amputation, and the other from during \r\nservice, showing an amputation.  Unfortunately, the copies of \r\nthese photographs are not very clear, and do not \r\nindependently demonstrate when the photographs were taken.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran has also submitted a Department of the Army \r\nNotification of Personnel action from 1952 indicating that he \r\nthen had a physical impairment in the form of loss of a \r\nforefinger of the left hand, and there is a more recent VA \r\nmedical record from 2001 indicating that he has an obvious \r\npartial amputation on his left index finger.  The veteran \r\nreports that this occurred in service because he got \r\nfrostbite and it had to be amputated.  Although he is not \r\ncompetent to testify concerning the medical reason for the \r\namputation, he is competent to indicate he had an amputation \r\nin service, as this would be the type of thing that is \r\nreadily apparent even to a layperson.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 \r\nVet. App. 465 (1994); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398 \r\n(1995).  I accept the veteran's testimony, together with \r\nevidence showing the existence of the partial amputation of \r\nhis left index finger as early as 1952, as evidence that \r\nthere was a partial left index finger amputation in service.  \r\n\r\nAlthough there is one treatment record from August 1967 that \r\nappears to refer to a splinter under the veteran's left index \r\nfingernail, the word \"left\" is written over another word; \r\nmoreover, this record is contradicted by the 1952 record that \r\nthe veteran's left forefinger was absent.  Weighing the \r\nAugust 1967 record with the other evidence, I conclude that \r\nit does not prove that the veteran's left index finger was \r\nintact in 1967.  \r\n\r\nSince the claim is being granted, any deficiencies in VA's \r\nduties to notify the veteran and assist him regarding his \r\nclaim for service connection for a partial left index finger \r\namputation are of no prejudice.  Similarly, because the claim \r\nis being granted, there is now no prejudice to the veteran in \r\nnot giving him notice, as required by Dingess v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), of the veteran's status, effective \r\ndate, or degree of disability elements for the service-\r\nconnection claim.  The effective date of service connection \r\nand the degree of the service-connected disability have not \r\nyet been decided, and the RO still has the opportunity to \r\ncorrect any notice deficiencies concerning these matters.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, and given the facts of this \r\ncase, deciding the appeal at this time is not prejudicial to \r\nthe claimant.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a partial left hand index finger \r\namputation is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMARY GALLAGHER\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "60b60661f8611168dd279c95", "name": "0601461.txt", "plainText": "Citation Nr: 0601461\t\r\nDecision Date: 01/18/06    Archive Date: 01/31/06\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  04-17 231\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in No. Little \r\nRock, Arkansas\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for hepatitis C.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tThe American Legion\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nP. Olson, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from May 1971 to July \r\n1976.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board or BVA) on appeal from a July 2003 rating decision of \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) \r\nin N. Little Rock, Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIn August 2004, the veteran testified at a video conference \r\nhearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A \r\ntranscript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nIn September 2002, the veteran claimed cirrhosis of the liver \r\nsecondary to alcoholism and PTSD.  In his Notice of \r\nDisagreement received in August 2003, the veteran also stated \r\nthat he was claiming cirrhosis as a secondary condition to \r\nhis hepatitis C.  As is unclear whether the veteran wishes to \r\ncontinue to pursue this claim, it is referred to the RO for \r\nappropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe only risk factor shown in the evidence is the veteran's \r\nreceipt of inoculations during service, and a medical \r\nprofessional has stated this is the only risk factor the \r\nveteran has for developing hepatitis C.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all doubt in the veteran's favor, hepatitis C was \r\nincurred in active service. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. \r\nNo. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000) (codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102-5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. \r\n2005)), imposes obligations on VA in terms of its duties to \r\nnotify and assist claimants.  The Board observes that in \r\nlight of the favorable outcome of this appeal, any perceived \r\nlack of notice or development under the VCAA should not be \r\nconsidered prejudicial.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the \r\nappellant's claims folder, which includes, but is not limited \r\nto:  the veteran's service medical records; prior rating \r\ndecisions; the appellant's contentions including testimony \r\npresented at the August 2004 video conference hearing; a VA \r\nexamination report dated in July 2003; and VA medical records \r\nfor treatment from January 1998.  Although the Board has an \r\nobligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this \r\ndecision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the \r\nextensive evidence submitted by the appellant or on his \r\nbehalf.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. \r\nCir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does \r\nnot have to discuss each piece of evidence).  Rather, the \r\nBoard's analysis below will focus specifically on what the \r\nevidence shows, or fails to show, on each claim.  See \r\nTimberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law \r\nrequires only that the Board address its reasons for \r\nrejecting evidence favorable to the claimant).\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that his current diagnosis of hepatitis \r\nC is related to service.  Specifically, the veteran indicates \r\nthat he believes his current diagnosis of hepatitis C is \r\nrelated to either being exposed to blood via a mass \r\ninoculation (\"air gun\"), an incident in which medicine was \r\ninjected into his finger with a previously-used needle, or an \r\nincident in which he was exposed to another's blood while in \r\nthe shower.\r\n\r\nService connection means that the facts establish that a \r\nparticular injury or disease resulting in disability was \r\nincurred in the line of duty in the active military service \r\nor, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated during \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  The \r\nfirst question that must be addressed, therefore, is whether \r\nincurrence of hepatitis C is factually shown during service.  \r\nThe Board concludes it was not.  The service medical records \r\nare absent complaints, findings or diagnoses of hepatitis \r\nduring service.  Thus, there is no medical evidence that \r\nshows that the veteran suffered from hepatitis during \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nAlternatively, when a chronic disease is not present during \r\nservice, service connection may be established under \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) by evidence of continuity of \r\nsymptomatology.  Such evidence is lacking here.  The veteran \r\ntestified in August 2004 that he was diagnosed with hepatitis \r\nC in 1998, and the medical evidence confirms that is when the \r\ndiagnosis was first made.  \r\n\r\nWhen a disease is first diagnosed after service, service \r\nconnection can still be granted for that condition if the \r\nevidence shows it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.303(d).  To prevail on the issue of service connection \r\nthere must be medical evidence of a current disability; \r\nmedical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence \r\nof in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or \r\ninjury; and medical evidence of a nexus between an in-service \r\ninjury or disease and the current disability.  See Hickson v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); see also Pond v. West, 12 \r\nVet App. 341, 346 (1999).  In this case, the appellant \r\nclearly has a current disability.  The remaining question, \r\ntherefore, is whether there is medical evidence of a \r\nrelationship between the current disability and military \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Board points out that risk factors for hepatitis C \r\ninclude intravenous (IV) drug use, blood transfusions before \r\n1992, hemodialysis, intranasal cocaine, high-risk sexual \r\nactivity, accidental exposure while a health care worker, and \r\nvarious kinds of percutaneous exposure such as tattoos, body \r\npiercing, acupuncture with non-sterile needles, shared \r\ntoothbrushes or razor blades.  VBA Letter 211B (98-110) \r\nNovember 30, 1998.\r\n\r\nIn a January 2000 Preventive Care record, the veteran \r\nreported  that he had hepatitis C and answered, \"yes\" to \r\nthe question, \"Do any of these risk factors apply to you; \r\nrec'd blood, been on dialysis, work with blood/blood \r\nproducts, had many sex partners, used injected drugs, have \r\ntattoos, used cocaine, live a person with Hepatitis C.\"  No \r\nfurther details were provided.  In contrast, a prior VA \r\nhistory dated in June 1999 indicates \"yes\" for the presence \r\nof Hepatitis C, but \"no\" for any risk factors.\r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2003.  The \r\nexaminer reported that the veteran denied all known risk \r\nfactors specifically stating, \"I just do not know how I got \r\nit in.\"  The examiner reported that the veteran's history \r\nwas negative for transfusion, drug use, and other such known \r\nrisk factors.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran testified that he may have been exposed to \r\nhepatitis C during a medical procedure in which his finger \r\nwas sutured.  The veteran stated that he cut his finger while \r\nin Vietnam, and the medic asked the veteran if he minded if \r\nhe used painkiller that they had left over from another case.  \r\nWhile there is evidence that the veteran received stitches \r\nwhen he cut his left index finger in March 1973 (after his \r\ntour in Vietnam) and that his finger was infiltrated with \r\nlidocaine and sutured, there is no evidence corroborating his \r\nallegation that the needle used to administer the lidocaine \r\nhad been used previously to treat other individuals.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran also testified that there was an incident when he \r\nwas in the shower and a woman came into the shower and blood \r\nwent all over the shower floor.  The veteran testified that \r\nalthough he was wearing shower shoes, he was still exposed to \r\nthe blood.  However, there is no evidence corroborating his \r\nallegation that this incident occurred.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the veteran's contention that his hepatitis C \r\nis related to \"air gun\" inoculations, the veteran testified \r\nthat while in boot camp May 1971, he went though inoculations \r\nwhere the drill instructor used a pneumatic inoculator on \r\nevery person in series.  \r\n\r\nIn an April 2003 medical report, Dr. AHM, of the \r\ngastroenterology department, noted no history of IV drug use, \r\nno tattoos, sexual exposure overseas but \"safe sex\", and \r\nmass inoculation using same air gun on several people.  The \r\nphysician stated, \"this is the only possible potential risk \r\nfactor for HCV that he could identify or at least that the \r\npatient will volunteer.\"  \r\nThe veteran's service record indicates that he was a Marine \r\nCorps recruit from May to July 1971.  The record indicates \r\nthat the veteran received a yellow fever vaccine on July 12, \r\n1971.  The Board also notes that the record does not \r\nspecifically identify any other risk factors for hepatitis C.  \r\nThe Board has reviewed all the medical evidence in the \r\nveteran's claims file.  Although he has a history of alcohol \r\nand marijuana use, he has consistently denied using any other \r\nillegal substances or using IV drugs.  The majority of these \r\ndenials are shown prior to his VA claim in 2002 and, in fact, \r\nprior to diagnosis of Hepatitis C in 1998.  This lends \r\nadditional credibility to his current denials of such risk \r\nfactors, and there is no evidence contradicting his \r\ntestimony.  In reviewing his occupational history in the VA \r\noutpatient treatment records from 1985 to the present, there \r\nis no indication he worked in a medical field where he would \r\nbe exposed to blood products.  His past surgical history has \r\nbeen listed as only a tonsillectomy - a procedure that would \r\nnot ordinarily involve a blood transfusion, and there is no \r\nindication that it did.  The veteran denies having any \r\ntattoos, and a VA outpatient treatment record dated in \r\nJanuary 2001 (well over a year before the veteran filed his \r\nclaim) indicated no history of tattoos, blood transfusions, \r\nor piercings.  Again, then, there is no evidence \r\ncontradicting the veteran's denial of these risk factors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only risk factor, as labeled by a medical \r\nprofessional, is the fact that the veteran received \r\ninoculations during service.  According to the Veterans \r\nBenefits Administration, despite the lack of any scientific \r\nevidence to document transmission of HCV with air gun \r\ninjectors, it is biologically plausible.  VBA Fast Letter 04-\r\n13 (June 29, 2004).  This \"plausibility,\" although not even \r\nremotely definitive, is the only possible explanation shown \r\nin this veteran's record for the transmission of Hepatitis C.  \r\nAlthough the Fast Letter also notes the source of infection \r\nis unknown in some cases, this appears to invoke resolution \r\nof reasonable doubt in the veteran's favor, when the only \r\nrisk factor shown for this veteran are the in-service \r\ninoculations.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the \r\nveteran, the Board concludes that the veteran likely incurred \r\nhepatitis C while on active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.

Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 \r\n(2006), which held that the notice requirements of \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all \r\nfive elements of a service-connection claim, including the \r\ndegree of disability and the effective date of an award.  In \r\nthe present appeal, the appellant was not provided with \r\nnotice of the type of evidence necessary to establish a \r\ndisability rating or an effective date, if service connection \r\nwas granted on appeal.  When implementing the award, the RO \r\nwill address any notice defect with respect to the disability \r\nrating and effective date elements.  Significantly, the \r\nveteran retains the right to appeal any effective date or \r\ninitial disability rating assigned by the RO.   \r\n\r\nWithout deciding whether VA's notice and development \r\nrequirements have been satisfied in the present case with \r\nrespect to the issue of PTSD, the Board is taking action \r\nfavorable to the veteran by granting service connection for \r\nPTSD, as such the Board finds that there has been no \r\nprejudice to the veteran that would warrant further notice or \r\ndevelopment and the Board will proceed with appellate review.  \r\nSee, e.g., VAOPGCPREC 16-92, 57 Fed. Reg. 49, 747 (1992); See \r\nConway v. Principi, 353 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Sutton v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 553 (1996); Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. \r\n384 (1993).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he is entitled to service \r\nconnection for PTSD.  He alleges exposure to various \r\nstressors during his wartime service in Vietnam and claims \r\nthat he has acquired PTSD as a result of such exposure.  \r\n\r\nIn general, service connection may be granted for a \r\ndisability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or \r\naggravated by active military service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.1(k), 3.303(a) (2005).  In \r\norder to prevail in a claim for service connection there must \r\nbe medical evidence of a current disability as established by \r\na medical diagnosis; of incurrence or aggravation of a \r\ndisease or injury in service, established by lay or medical \r\nevidence; and of a nexus between the in-service injury or \r\ndisease and the current disability established by medical \r\nevidence.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2000).  Where a veteran who served for ninety days or more \r\nduring a period of war develops certain chronic diseases, \r\nsuch as psychosis, to a degree of 10 percent or more within \r\none year from separation from service, such diseases may be \r\npresumed to have been incurred in service even though there \r\nis no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  \r\nThis presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the \r\ncontrary.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137 (West \r\n2002 & Supp. 2006); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309 (2005).  \r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d) (2005).  Further, \r\nif a condition noted during service is not shown to be \r\nchronic, then generally, a showing of continuity of symptoms \r\nafter service is required for service connection.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) (2005).\r\n\r\nWith regard to PTSD, VA regulations reflect that symptoms \r\nattributable to PTSD are often not manifest in service.  \r\nAccordingly, service connection for PTSD requires a current \r\nmedical diagnosis of PTSD (presumed to include the adequacy \r\nof the PTSD symptomatology and the sufficiency of a claimed \r\nin-service stressor), credible supporting evidence that the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and medical \r\nevidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and \r\nthe specific claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.304(f); 67 Fed. Reg. 10,330, 10,332 (Mar. 7, 2002) \r\n(codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f)); see also Cohen \r\nv. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 138 (1997) (citing Moreau v. \r\nBrown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394-95 (1996)).  Specifically, to \r\nestablish entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the \r\nveteran must submit \"...medical evidence diagnosing the \r\ncondition in accordance with \ufffd 4.125(a) of this chapter; a \r\nlink, established by medical evidence, between current \r\nsymptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.\"  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) (2005).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the record clearly establishes the first two \r\nelements of the 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) analysis: a current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD and an opinion linking such diagnosis to \r\nthe veteran's reported in-service stressors.  On the \r\nveteran's September 1969 separation examination report, his \r\npsychiatric condition was noted as clinically normal.  At a \r\nNovember 2001 VA PTSD examination, the veteran reported that, \r\nduring his tour in Vietnam, he was involved in direct combat \r\nto include search and destroy operations, night ambush, \r\nfirefights, perimeter defense, and mine sweeping.  His \r\nfriends were killed and/or wounded as a result of enemy \r\naction.  Further, the veteran observed bombs released on a \r\nMarine unit 100 yards from the veteran's location north of \r\nthe Village of Namo.  The veteran stated that he witnessed \r\nthe entire sequence of events and responded to the scene \r\nwhere approximately 25 Marines were killed.  Based on the \r\nveteran's claimed stressors, the VA examiner diagnosed the \r\nveteran with chronic and severe PTSD and noted enduring \r\ncombat residuals relating to his PTSD.  Subsequently, the \r\nveteran continued to receive treatment from VA Medical \r\nCenters (VAMC) for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe remaining element, credible supporting evidence that the \r\nveteran's reported in-service stressor(s) actually occurred, \r\nis required for service connection.  See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. \r\nat 142.  The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence \r\nof a stressor during service to support a claim for PTSD will \r\nvary depending on whether the veteran was \"engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\"  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 \r\n(1993).  If the evidence establishes that the veteran was \r\nengaged in combat with the enemy or was a prisoner of war \r\n(POW), and the claimed stressor is related to combat or POW \r\nexperiences (in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressors are \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the veteran's service), the veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, VA determines that the veteran did not engage \r\nin combat with the enemy and was not a POW, or the claimed \r\nstressor is not related to combat or POW experiences, the \r\nveteran's lay statements, by themselves, will not be enough \r\nto establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  \r\nInstead, the record must contain service records or other \r\ncredible evidence, which corroborates the stressor.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(d), (f); \r\nGaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353, 357-58 (1998).  Such \r\ncorroborating evidence cannot consist solely of after-the-\r\nfact medical nexus evidence.  See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 396.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of whether the appellant served \r\nin combat with the enemy, the Board has considered his \r\nmilitary personnel and medical records, the veteran's own \r\nstatements, and a lay statement.  The veteran's service \r\npersonnel records reflect that his military occupation (MOS) \r\nwas heavy equipment operator and show that he was stationed \r\nin the Republic of Vietnam from August 1967 to March 1969.  \r\nThe veteran received the National Defense Service Medal, \r\nVietnam Service Medal, and Vietnam Campaign Ribbon with 60 \r\ndevice.  He received no individual combat citations and was \r\nnot a POW.  His service medical records reveal no combat \r\nwounds.  Thus, the evidence of record does not establish that \r\nthe appellant was engaged in combat in connection with his \r\nMOS.  The preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\ndetermination of combat status.  Therefore, the veteran's \r\nstatements alone do not constitute conclusive evidence of the \r\noccurrence of an in-service stressor.  See Cohen, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. at 145.  The Board therefore finds that, based on all \r\nthe evidence, the appellant did not engage in combat during \r\nhis tour in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nAlthough the record does not establish the veteran's combat \r\nstatus, the Board observes partial, independent corroboration \r\nof the veteran's alleged in-service stressors.  First, as it \r\nconcerns the veteran's credibility, the veteran's DA Form 20 \r\nreflects that the veteran was assigned to the 517th Engineer \r\nCompany (Light Equipment) attached to the 35th Engineer \r\nBattalion (Combat) between August 1967 and January 1969.  The \r\nveteran contends that he generally was exposed to ground, \r\nmortar, and rocket attacks while serving in Vietnam.  A \r\nletter of \"Valorous Unit Award\" from the Department of the \r\nArmy confirms that the 517th Engineer Company was attached to \r\nthe 35th Engineer Battalion between February 8 and September \r\n15, 1968.  Further, the citation shows that the veteran's \r\nunit operated under hazardous environmental conditions and \r\nwas subjected to frequent ambushes, sniper fire, and \r\nrocket/mortar attacks.  \r\n\r\nThe November 2001 PTSD diagnosis provisionally was based on \r\nambushes, firefights, and the bombing of a nearby Marine \r\nunit.  As a member of the 517th Engineer Company stationed \r\nnear Da Nang, Vietnam, the veteran was likely exposed to \r\nenemy attacks/fire.  Further, the claims file contains a \r\nstatement from a veteran, who served with the 35th Engineer \r\nBattalion, reporting that the appellant responded to the \r\nbombing incident.  The veteran's DA Form 20 reflects that he \r\nwas involved in the Vietnam Counter Defensive Campaign, Phase \r\nIII.  The Board observes that the corroborative nature of the \r\nevidence goes toward the veteran's credibility.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the aforementioned stressors is not clearly \r\nconvincing; however, the Board observes that the veteran is \r\nentitled to the benefit-of-the-doubt on the issue of stressor \r\ncorroboration.  At a minimum, the evidence discussed above \r\nsuggests a possibility that the veteran was assigned to a \r\nunit targeted by sniper/rocket attacks.  The Court determined \r\nthat corroboration of every detail is not required.  \r\nPentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124 (2002) (citing Suozzi \r\nv. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997).  The veteran's DA Form 20 \r\nand DD Form 214 do not specifically reflect that the veteran \r\nwas present during the rocket attacks, but the records \r\nindicate plausibility.  Pentecost, 16 Vet. App. at 128.  On \r\nthat issue, the Board finds the evidence in relative \r\nequipoise, and resolves reasonable doubt in favor the \r\nveteran.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.102 (2005).  As the aforementioned corroborated non-\r\ncombat stressors form, in part, the basis of the veteran's \r\ncurrent (provisional) PTSD diagnosis, the Board concludes \r\nthat the veteran suffers from PTSD incurred in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nA.

DeFrank, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from March 1953 to March 1957, \r\nfrom March 1958 to June 1966 and from March 1967 to March \r\n1975.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal of a May 2003 rating decision of the \r\nHouston, Texas regional office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA).\r\n\r\nIn May 2006, the veteran testified before the undersigned at \r\na hearing held at the San Antonio, Texas, satellite office of \r\nthe RO.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that in addition to other service connected \r\ndisabilities, the veteran is currently service connected for \r\nhypothyroidism at a 30 percent disability rating effective \r\nMay 31, 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nCurrent sleep apnea had its onset in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nSleep apnea was incurred in active duty military service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2006). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2006); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2006). \r\n\r\nThe VCAA is not applicable where further assistance would not \r\naid the appellant in substantiating his claim.  Wensch v. \r\nPrincipi, 15 Vet App 362 (2001); see 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n5103A(a)(2) (Secretary not required to provide assistance \r\n\"if no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance \r\nwould aid in substantiating the claim\"); see also VAOPGCPREC \r\n5-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59989 (2004) (holding that the notice \r\nand duty to assist provisions of the VCAA do not apply to \r\nclaims that could not be substantiated through such notice \r\nand assistance).  In view of the Board's favorable decision \r\nin this appeal, further assistance is unnecessary to aid the \r\nveteran in substantiating his claim.  \r\n\r\nApplicable laws and regulations in service connection claims\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131.  \r\n\r\nService connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) \r\nthe existence of a present disability; (2) in-service \r\nincurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a \r\ncausal relationship between the present disability and the \r\ndisease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  \r\nShedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); \r\nsee also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995). \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disease first \r\ndiagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d) (2006).\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the \r\nresponsibility to present and support a claim for benefits \r\nunder laws administered by the Secretary.  The Secretary \r\nshall consider all information and lay and medical evidence \r\nof record in a case before the Secretary with respect to \r\nbenefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding any issue material to the determination of \r\na matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt \r\nto the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107 (West 2002); see also \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records are negative for \r\ntreatment, complaints or diagnosis of sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nIn June 2001, the veteran presented to the San Antonio, Texas \r\nVAMC where his problem list included a diagnosis of sleep \r\napnea.  VAMC treatment notes in February 2002, December 2002, \r\nJanuary 2003 and February 2003 all noted the veteran's \r\nhistory of sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nIn April 2003, the veteran presented to a private physician \r\nfor a detailed examination of his established medical \r\nconditions that included hypothyroidism.  The treatment notes \r\nstated that the veteran was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism in \r\n1970.  He presented with complaints of easy fatigability, \r\npoor memory, sleepiness, difficulty with breathing, tremors, \r\nslowness of thought and difficulty swallowing.  The veteran \r\nstated that he also had sleep apnea and many of the symptoms \r\noverlapped.\r\n\r\nIn September 2003, an acquaintance of the veteran who was \r\nassigned to the same quarters as the veteran from 1968 to \r\n1969 provided a statement.  The letter stated that he could \r\nattest to the fact that the veteran used to stop breathing \r\nwhile he slept.  He stated that he saw the veteran stop \r\nbreathing on several occasions while he was sleeping and \r\nadvised him to seek medical attention.  He also noted that \r\nwhen he was tired, the veteran would fall asleep while he was \r\ntalking.  He would not allow the veteran to operate vehicles \r\nbecause the veteran would fall asleep when driving. \r\n\r\nA note from the South Bexar VA Outpatient Clinic in April \r\n2004 stated that the veteran had been receiving care at that \r\nfacility for hypertension, sleep apnea and chronic low back \r\npain.\r\n\r\nIn a May 2004 sleep study conducted at the San Antonio VAMC, \r\nthe veteran stated that he has had sleep apnea since the \r\n1960's.  He reported a previous sleep study in 1987 in \r\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico where he was diagnosed with \r\nobstructive sleep apnea syndrome.  \r\n\r\nIn June 2004, the veteran underwent a sleep consultation at \r\nthe San Antonio, Texas VAMC.  The diagnosis was severe \r\nobstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\r\n\r\nIn May 2005, the veteran underwent a comprehensive VA \r\nexamination for his sleep apnea.  The veteran stated that his \r\nfriends in the military told him that he snored a lot.  \r\nHowever, he was not diagnosed with sleep apnea until a sleep \r\nstudy in 1986.  His symptoms have improved dramatically since \r\na June 2004 sleep study.  The diagnosis was severe sleep \r\napnea that had been much improved.\r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that there was no information regarding \r\nsleep apnea in the veteran's claims file.  As a result, the \r\nexaminer was unable to determine the onset of the sleep apnea \r\nas it was strictly speculation on anyone's part to state when \r\nhis sleep apnea developed.\r\n\r\nIn May 2006, the veteran presented to a VAMC sleep clinic for \r\nan evaluation.  The veteran reported problems with loud \r\nsnoring, daytime sleepiness and fatigue dating back to 1967.  \r\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nThe treating physician noted that the veteran was service \r\nconnected for hypothyroidism.  He stated that hypothyroidism \r\nand sleep apnea may both be associated with symptoms of \r\nfatigue and daytime sleepiness and it was certainly possible \r\nthat the veteran was having symptoms of sleepiness and \r\nfatigue related to sleep apnea when his hypothyroidism first \r\ncame to clinical attention.  However, he noted that the \r\nclaims file and military medical records were not available \r\nfor review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nWith regard to the elements of service connection, the \r\nveteran has a present disability as there are current \r\ndiagnoses of severe sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nThe remaining determinations involve whether there was an in-\r\nservice disease or injury and whether there is a causal \r\nrelationship between the present disability and the disease \r\nor injury during service.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records are entirely negative \r\nfor any manifestations of sleep apnea, the veteran and a \r\nservice acquaintance have, however, reported symptoms in \r\nservice.  They are competent to report such observable \r\nsymptoms.  The veteran's physician linked these symptoms to \r\nsleep apnea.  The record, thus, supports a finding of a \r\ndisease or injury in service.\r\n\r\nThe remaining question is whether the current disability can \r\nbe linked to disease or injury in service.  The VA examiner \r\nreported that he was unable to provide an opinion in this \r\nregard without resort to speculation.  The examiner, however, \r\nrelied on an inaccurate history.  The examiner stated that \r\nthere was no evidence of sleep apnea in the claims folder.  \r\nAt the time of the examination, the claims folder contained \r\ndiagnoses of sleep apnea as well as the veteran's competent \r\nreports of symptoms in service.  The examiner's opinion is \r\ntherefore of little probative value.  Boggs v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 334, 345 (1998); see also Kightly v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. \r\n200, 205-06 (1994) (finding that presumption of credibility \r\nof evidence did not arise as to medical opinion based on an \r\ninaccurate history); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 \r\n(1993) (finding that presumption of credibility did not arise \r\nbecause physician's opinion was based upon \"an inaccurate \r\nfactual premise\" and thus had \"no probative value\" since it \r\nrelied upon veteran's \"account of his medical history and \r\nservice background).\r\n\r\nThe May 2006 opinion from a treating physician finds that it \r\nwas certainly possible that the veteran was having symptoms \r\nrelated to sleep apnea when his hypothyroidism first came to \r\nclinical attention in service.  This physician did not have \r\naccess to the claims folder, but the reported history is \r\naccurate.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006) \r\n(holding an opinion based on a history supplied by the \r\nveteran lacks credibility only if the history is inaccurate).\r\n\r\nVA decision makers have the responsibility to assess the \r\ncredibility of evidence and determine the degree of weight to \r\ngive the evidence.  Decision makers have discretion to accept \r\nor reject pieces of evidence, provided that sufficient \r\nreasons and bases are set forth explaining such actions.  \r\nHayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993), citing Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-193 (1992).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds the May 2006 opinion to be of more probative \r\nvalue than that of the VA examiner.  The May 2006 opinion can \r\nbe read as saying that it is at least as likely as not that \r\nthe current sleep apnea had its onset in service.\r\n\r\nResolving reasonable doubt in the veteran's favor, service \r\nconnection for sleep apnea is granted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n5107(b).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMark D.

Salari, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1975 to \r\nSeptember 1978 and from April 1982 to April 2002, with \r\nadditional service in the reserves.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a January 2003 RO decision.  The veteran \r\ntestified at a hearing before the Board in March 2005.  The \r\nBoard remanded the case in September 2005.  \r\n\r\nIn its September 2005 remand, the Board also remanded claims \r\nfor service connection for left shoulder and left knee \r\ndisabilities.  In April 2006, the RO awarded service \r\nconnection for these disabilities.  Once service connection \r\nis awarded for a disability, the issue of the disability \r\nrating assigned to that disability is \"downstream\" from the \r\nissue of service connection.  Thus, a separate, jurisdiction-\r\nconferring notice of disagreement is needed with regard to \r\nany \"downstream\" issues.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F. 3d \r\n1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  As there has been a complete \r\ngrant of benefits with regard to these claims, they are no \r\nlonger involved in the present appeal to the Board.  But in \r\nAugust 2006, the veteran's representative filed a document \r\nthat appears to be a notice of disagreement (NOD) regarding \r\nthe noncompensable rating assigned to his service-connected \r\nleft knee disability.  This NOD is very recent.  The RO has \r\nnot yet had any opportunity to review the NOD or to issue the \r\nappropriate statement of the case because the claims folder \r\nwas located at the Board, not at the RO, when the veteran's \r\nrepresentative filed the August 2006 NOD regarding the left \r\nknee rating.  Therefore, the  Board refers this matter to the \r\nRO for appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\nIn August 2006, the veteran's representative stated that the \r\nissues on appeal included service connection for left \r\nshoulder and bilateral knee disabilities.  But as discussed \r\nabove, the only issue on appeal is stated in the caption.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran sustained injuries to the right knee during \r\nservice, which are medically linked to hypertrophic changes \r\nin the intercondylar region, as noted on X-rays.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for a right knee \r\ndisability have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication, VA must notify the claimant and any \r\nrepresentative of any information, medical evidence, or lay \r\nevidence not previously provided to VA that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  This notice requires VA to indicate \r\nwhich portion of that information and evidence is to be \r\nprovided by the claimant and which portion VA will attempt to \r\nobtain on the claimant's behalf.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2005).  The \r\nnotice must: (1) inform the claimant about the information \r\nand evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim; (2) inform the claimant about the information and \r\nevidence that VA will seek to provide; (3) inform the \r\nclaimant about the information and evidence the claimant is \r\nexpected to provide; and (4) request or tell the claimant to \r\nprovide any evidence in the claimant's possession that \r\npertains to the claim, or something to the effect that the \r\nclaimant should \"give us everything you've got pertaining to \r\nyour claim(s).\"  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, \r\n120-21 (2004).  \r\n\r\nThe RO sent correspondence in September 2002; a rating \r\ndecision in January 2003; a statement of the case in March \r\n2003; and supplemental statements of the case in June 2004 \r\nand August 2004.  The September 2002 letter preceded the \r\ninitial adjudicative decision by the RO on the issue of \r\nservice connection for a right knee disability (that is, the \r\nJanuary 2003 rating decision), and it set forth substantially \r\nall of the required elements of VA's duty to notify \r\nclaimants.  Also, all the documents discussed specific \r\nevidence, the applicable legal requirements, the evidence \r\nconsidered, the pertinent laws and regulations, and the \r\nreasons for the decisions.  VA made all efforts to notify and \r\nto assist the appellant with regard to the evidence obtained, \r\nthe evidence needed, the responsibilities of the parties in \r\nobtaining the evidence, and the general notice of the need \r\nfor any evidence in the appellant's possession.  The Board \r\nfinds that even if there is any defect with regard to the \r\ntiming or content of any of the notices sent prior to the \r\nRO's initial adjudication in January 2003, that defect is \r\nharmless because of the thorough and informative notices \r\nprovided throughout the adjudication and because the \r\nappellant has had a meaningful opportunity to participate \r\neffectively in the processing of the claim with an \r\nadjudication of the claim by the RO subsequent to receipt of \r\nthe required notice.  VA effectively complied with all of the \r\nrequired elements under VA's duty to notify claimants prior \r\nto the last adjudication here (a June 2006 supplemental \r\nstatement of the case).  There has been no prejudice to the \r\nappellant, and any defect in the timing or content of the \r\nnotices has not affected the fairness of the adjudication.  \r\nSee Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on \r\nother grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (specifically \r\ndeclining to address harmless error doctrine); see also \r\nDingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).   Thus, VA \r\nsatisfied its duty to notify the appellant.  \r\n\r\nAlso, all relevant, identified, and available evidence has \r\nbeen obtained, and VA has notified the appellant of any \r\nevidence that could not be obtained.  In particular, VA has \r\nobtained all service medical records and identified VA \r\nmedical treatment records.  VA has examined the veteran \r\nseveral times.  The appellant has not referred to any \r\nadditional, unobtained, relevant evidence.  Thus, VA has \r\nsatisfied both the notice and duty to assist provisions of \r\nthe law. \r\n \r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nduty. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.\r\n\r\nSome chronic diseases, including arthritis, may be presumed \r\nto have been incurred in service if manifested to a degree of \r\n10 percent or more within one year after separation from \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307, \r\n3.309(a).\r\n\r\nWhere there is a chronic disease shown as such in service, \r\nsubsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any \r\nlater date, however remote, are service connected, unless \r\nclearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  When a \r\ncondition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, or \r\nthe fact of chronicity in service is not adequately \r\nsupported, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology \r\nafter discharge is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.303(b).  Service connection may be granted for a disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nA determination of direct service connection requires (1) a \r\nmedical diagnosis of a current disability; (2) medical, or in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence \r\nor aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease \r\nand the current disability.  Epps v. Gober, 126 F.3d 1464 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 1997); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. \r\nCir. 1997); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); \r\nBrammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  Such \r\ndetermination is based on an analysis of all the evidence of \r\nrecord and evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  \r\nBaldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence on the merits of an issue material to a matter's \r\ndetermination, the benefit of the doubt in resolving that \r\nissue is given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West \r\n2002).\r\n\r\nAfter thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board \r\nfinds that service connection for a right knee disability is \r\nwarranted.  The veteran's service medical records clearly \r\ndocument ongoing complaints of pain since as early as 1989, \r\nas well as injuries to the right knee.  In April 1989, he had \r\na twisting injury causing pain and difficulty bending the \r\nright knee.  In April 1999, he was placed on a physical \r\nprofile due to bilateral knee sprain.  Since service, he has \r\ncontinued to have complaints of pain with the right knee.  \r\n\r\nVA examination in October 2002 noted that X-rays of both \r\nknees were normal; the diagnosis was that both knees were \r\nnormal without any residual trauma.  But these X-ray findings \r\nare diagnosis are is direct conflict with the more specific \r\ndiagnostic imaging technique of a February 1999 MRI that knee \r\ndocumented degenerative changes in the posterior horn of the \r\nmedial meniscus in the left knee.  Given the inaccuracy of \r\nthe October 2002 examination with regard to the left knee, \r\nthe Board must also discount the October 2002 VA examination \r\nregarding the right knee.\r\n\r\nWhile an MRI of the right knee was not conducted, as \r\nrequested by the Board's September 2005 remand, VA X-rays in \r\nDecember 2005 noted that the right knee showed minimal \r\nhypertrophic change in the intercondylar region, which my be \r\nrelated to chronic stress or early degenerative process.  \r\nHowever, the December 2005 VA examiner's diagnosis was that \r\nboth knees were normal without any residual trauma or \r\nevidence of instability.  At the same time, the examiner \r\nindicated that the appellant's right knee complaints were \r\nrelated to injuries he sustained in the military.  It appears \r\nthat the examiner's physical findings of the knees were \r\nnormal at that time and that the diagnosis was likely based \r\non those physical findings.  But clearly there was \r\nradiological evidence of a disorder in the right knee.  Given \r\nthe positive findings on the December 2005 X-rays, as well as \r\nthe December 2005 VA examiner's finding of a medical nexus \r\nbetween service and the veteran's current complaints, and \r\ngiven the fact that right knee complaints and injuries are \r\nclearly documented in service, resolving any doubt in favor \r\nof the veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a \r\nright knee disability is warranted.  The Board has considered \r\nthe benefit of the doubt in this decision.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5107(b).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a right knee disability is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nPANAYOTIS LAMBRAKOPOULOS\r\nActing Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "60b60661f8611168dd279c9c", "name": "0636017.txt", "plainText": "Citation Nr: 0636017\t\r\nDecision Date: 11/20/06    Archive Date: 11/28/06\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  05-00 292A\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in Oakland, \r\nCalifornia\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine \r\ndisability, to include a lumbar strain.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by: California Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nBarbara C. Morton, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1943 to \r\nJanuary 1946.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom an August 2004 decision by the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland, California, \r\nwhich denied service connection for a lumbar strain.  The RO \r\nissued a notice of the decision in August 2004, and the \r\nveteran timely filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in \r\nSeptember 2004.  Subsequently, in October 2004 the RO \r\nprovided a Statement of the Case (SOC), and thereafter, in \r\nJanuary 2005, the veteran timely filed a substantive appeal.\r\n\r\nThe veteran did not request a hearing on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.\tThe veteran currently has a lumbar spine disability, to \r\ninclude a lumbar strain.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe veteran had an in-service accident where he ran over a \r\nlandmine as he was operating a bulldozer; the competent \r\nmedical evidence of record indicates that an initial \r\nlumbar spine injury would be consistent with such an \r\nevent.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe competent medical evidence of record includes two \r\nconflicting medical opinions as to the origin of the \r\nveteran's current, chronic lumbar spine disability.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAs the evidence falls at least in relative equipoise, the \r\nbenefit of the doubt being received by the veteran, service \r\nconnection for a lumbar spine disability, to include a lumbar \r\nstrain, is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002 & Supp. \r\n2005); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2006).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe enactment of the VCAA, codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5102, \r\n5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002) significantly changed the law \r\nprior to the pendency of this claim.  VA has issued final \r\nregulations to implement these statutory changes.  See 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2005).  The VCAA \r\nprovisions include an enhanced duty to notify a claimant as \r\nto the information and evidence necessary to substantiate a \r\nclaim for VA benefits, and they redefine the obligations of \r\nVA with respect to the duty to assist the veteran with his \r\nclaim. \r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the Board has rendered a decision in \r\nfavor of the veteran, finding that service connection for a \r\nlumbar strain is warranted, and therefore, a further \r\ndiscussion of the VCAA duties is unnecessary at this time.  \r\nIt should be noted, however, that the RO should cure any \r\npotential defects in notice, as would be demonstrated by a \r\nfailure to notify the veteran of all five elements of a \r\nservice connection claim (to include the type of evidence \r\nnecessary to establish a disability rating and the effective \r\ndate for the claimed disability), or assistance provided by \r\nVA, prior to its determination of a proper disability rating \r\nand effective date for the veteran's service-connected \r\ndisability.  See Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, \r\n119-20 (2004) (holding that proper VCAA notice must \"precede \r\nan initial unfavorable [RO] decision\"); see also Dingess v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484, 486 (2006) (holding that \r\nthe VCAA notice requirements contained in 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements \r\nof a service connection claim, which include: (1) veteran \r\nstatus; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection \r\nbetween the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree \r\nof disability; and (5) effective date of the disability).   \r\n\r\n\r\nII. Law & Regulations\r\n\r\nFor service connection to be awarded, there must be: (1) \r\nmedical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical \r\nevidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of an in-\r\nservice incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and \r\n(3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-\r\nservice disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  \r\nCoburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006); accord \r\nDisabled Am. Veterans v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 419 F.3d \r\n1317, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d \r\n1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  If the veteran fails to \r\ndemonstrate any one element, denial of service connection \r\nwill result.  Disabled Am. Veterans, supra; Coburn, supra.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the \"current disability\" prong, \"[i]n the \r\nabsence of proof of a present disability there can be no \r\nvalid claim\" of service connection.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 \r\nVet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, \r\n505 (1995) (recognizing that \"[a] service-connection claim \r\nmust be accompanied by evidence which establishes that the \r\nclaimant currently has the claimed disability\"); see also \r\nChelte v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 268, 271, 272 (1997) (holding \r\nthat the veteran's claim was not well grounded when the \r\nevidence \"establishe[d] only that the veteran had a \r\n[disability] in the past, not that he has a current \r\ndisability\").\r\n\r\nTurning to the second, \"incurrence in or aggravation by \r\nservice\" prong, \"[s]ervice connection for VA disability \r\ncompensation . . . will be awarded to a veteran who served on \r\nactive duty during a period of war . . . for any disease or \r\ninjury that was incurred in or aggravated by\" such service.  \r\nCaluza, 7 Vet. App. at 505.  VA may grant service connection, \r\ndespite a diagnosis after discharge, when all the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\nveteran incurred the disease during service.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.303(d); accord Caluza, supra (\"When a disease is first \r\ndiagnosed after service, service connection may nevertheless \r\nbe established by evidence demonstrating that the disease was \r\nin fact 'incurred' during the veteran's service, or by \r\nevidence that a presumption period applied\").  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the third, \"nexus\" prong, the veteran must \r\ndemonstrate through medical evidence that \"a causal \r\nrelationship\" exists between the present disability and an \r\nin-service event.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.  Where the \r\ndeterminative issue involves medical causation or a medical \r\ndiagnosis, competent medical evidence must demonstrate that \r\nthe claim is plausible.  Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. \r\n492, 494 (1992).  Mere lay assertions of medical status do \r\nnot constitute competent medical evidence.  Moray v. Brown, 5 \r\nVet. App. 211, 214 (1993) (\"lay persons are not competent to \r\noffer medical opinions\").  Alternatively, a veteran can \r\nestablish a nexus between service and the current disability \r\nby offering medical or lay evidence of continuity of \r\nsymptomatology and medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\npresent disability and the symptomatology.  See Voerth v. \r\nWest, 13 Vet. App. 117, 120 (1999); Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 488, 495 (1997).\r\n\r\nA veteran will receive the benefit of the doubt when an \r\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence exists.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.  Thus, when a veteran \r\nseeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the \r\nveteran prevails.  Wells v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 33, 36 \r\n(2004); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54 (1990).  A \r\nclaim will be denied only if a preponderance of the evidence \r\nis against the claim.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, \r\n519-20 (1996).  \r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Analysis\r\n\r\na. Factual Background\r\nThe veteran's July 1943 Report of Physical Examination and \r\nInduction indicates that he had no musculoskeletal defects.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's December 1945 Report of Physical Examination \r\nfor Separation similarly contains a normal clinical \r\nevaluation of the veteran's spine, with no defects noted and \r\nno reports of injury.\r\n\r\nThe other available service medical records (SMRs) bear no \r\nindication of a lumbar spine disability, injury, or treatment \r\nfor such.\r\n\r\nThe veteran submitted a photocopy of a newspaper clipping, \r\ndated September 1943, which reported that the veteran had \r\nnarrowly escaped serious injury when he drove his bulldozer \r\nover a mine, which exploded beneath him.  The article further \r\nindicated that the blast had blown off the veteran's helmet \r\nand had knocked loose the track on the bulldozer.\r\n\r\nA private medical note by Dr. D.W.R., dated June 2003, \r\nindicates that the veteran complained of chronic back pain, \r\nwhich disrupted his sleep at night.  Dr. D.W.R. ordered an \r\nMRI of the lumbar spine at this time.  A September 2003 \r\nnotation again conveys the veteran's report of low back \r\ndiscomfort and pain.    \r\n\r\nAlso in September 2003, Dr. D.W.R. authored a letter, which \r\nnoted the veteran's history of chronic low back pain and \r\ndegenerative disc disease.  Dr. D.W.R. further reported the \r\nveteran's account of having been injured during his active \r\nservice, when he hit a landmine, which required treatment for \r\na year.  The veteran also conveyed to Dr. D.W.R. that he has \r\nexperienced degenerative changes in the low back since that \r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the current condition of the veteran's \r\nchronic back disability, Dr. D.W.R. indicated that the \r\nveteran required physical therapy to avoid any future \r\nsurgery.  He stated that the veteran displayed limited \r\nflexion to approximately 20 percent, with extension limited \r\nto about 50 percent.  The veteran exhibited limited lateral \r\nbending to approximately 70 percent bilaterally, with \r\nrotation limited to 30 percent.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dr. D.W.R. determined that it was reasonable \r\nby history to assume that the initial in-service landmine-\r\nrelated injury was as reported by the veteran.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran submitted to a VA examination in August 2004.  \r\nThe examiner, J.B., a family nurse practitioner, indicated \r\nthat the veteran had served as a heavy equipment operator \r\nduring his active service, and as he had reported to Dr. \r\nD.W.R., the veteran conveyed to J.B. that his initial lumbar \r\ninjury had occurred during service when a mine exploded under \r\nthe bulldozer that he operated.  The veteran indicated that \r\nhe had been medically evacuated to Saipan, where he received \r\ntreatment.  After his discharge from service, the veteran \r\nworked in construction as a foreman in the logging industry \r\nfor 10 years.  He did not report any work-related injuries. \r\n\r\nOn physical examination the veteran displayed lumbar spine \r\nflexion to 70 degrees, with low back pain, and 10 degrees \r\nextension, without pain.  He displayed 40 degrees rotation \r\nbilaterally without complaints of pain, and lateral bending \r\nof 10 degrees bilaterally with pain.  The spine had normal \r\ncurvature and was non-tender to palpitation.  \r\n\r\nBased on these data, J.B. diagnosed the veteran with lumbar \r\nstrain.  He proffered that this disability was less likely as \r\nnot related to the veteran's military landmine accident, \r\ngiven the veteran's 10-year interim work history in logging \r\nand construction, which he stated \"could have\" contributed \r\nto the lumbar disability.  J.B. further stated that there was \r\nnot enough evidence in the claims file to substantiate the \r\nlumbar disability at separation or recently thereafter.  \r\n \r\n\r\nb. Discussion\r\nThe Board determines that the evidence of record shows that \r\nthe veteran currently has a lumbar spine disability, to \r\ninclude a lumbar strain, as demonstrated by the reports and \r\nfindings of Dr. D.W.R. and J.B.  \r\n \r\nAs for whether the veteran incurred this injury during \r\nservice and whether a causal link connects his current \r\ndisability and his in-service landmine accident, the Board \r\ndetermines that the evidence of record falls at least in \r\nrelative equipoise, in which case, the veteran prevails.  \r\nWhile the Board acknowledges that the veteran's SMRs do not \r\nindicate that he received treatment for a lumbar spine injury \r\nduring service, which would weigh against his claim, the \r\nveteran has corroborated his account of the injury-causing \r\nlandmine explosion through the September 1943 newspaper \r\narticle, which described the impact as having blown off the \r\nveteran's helmet and knocking off a track of the bulldozer.  \r\nSuch an impact, as intimated by Dr. D.W.R. in his September \r\n2003 correspondence, reasonably would have caused the initial \r\nlumbar injury.  This opposing evidence, weighing both in \r\nfavor of and against the veteran's claim, falls in relative \r\nequipoise, in which case, the veteran will receive the \r\nbenefit of the doubt.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the veteran's current lumbar \r\ndisability, the Board recognizes that two medical opinions of \r\nrecord also fall in contradiction of one another.  \r\nSpecifically, the VA examiner concluded that the veteran's \r\ncurrent lumbar strain was less likely as not related to his \r\nin-service accident, while the veteran's private physician, \r\nDr. D.W.R., determined that it was reasonable to assume that \r\nthe initial in-service lumbar injury was the cause of the \r\nchronic disability.  In such a circumstance, the Board must \r\ndetermine how much weight to afford each opinion.  See \r\nGuerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 471 (1993).  The Board \r\nmay place greater weight on one medical professional's \r\nopinion over another, depending on factors such as the \r\nreasoning employed, medical expertise, the thoroughness and \r\ndetail of the opinion, whether or not, and the extent to \r\nwhich, they reviewed prior clinical records or the claims \r\nfile, and other evidence.  See id., at 470-71 (\"The \r\nprobative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the \r\nmedical expert's personal examination of the patient, the \r\nphysician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and \r\nthe medical conclusion that the physician reaches\"); accord \r\nPrejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-49 (2000).  The \r\nBoard's determination in this regard must be explained in a \r\nstatement providing adequate reasons and bases.  Owens v. \r\nBrown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995) (noting that the Board may \r\n\"favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over that \r\nof another when the Board gives an adequate statement of \r\nreasons and bases\").     \r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the Board determines that both opinions \r\nat least roughly balance each other out, in which case, the \r\nveteran prevails.  The relatively contemporaneous opinions \r\nboth contain comparable analysis and reasoning to support the \r\nrespective positions, and the veteran provided a similar \r\nhistorical account of the in-service accident to both \r\nclinicians.  Although the Board finds questionable J.B.'s \r\ndetermination that the veteran's military accident less \r\nlikely as not caused the veteran's current lumbar disability \r\nbased, in part, on speculation that the veteran's post-\r\nservice work in construction \"could have\" contributed to \r\nthe lumbar disability, J.B. correctly did acknowledge that \r\nthe SMRs are lacking of evidence demonstrating a lumbar spine \r\ndisability.  To the extent that this opinion preponderates \r\nagainst the veteran's claim, the Board determines that this \r\nunfavorable opinion is equally balanced by Dr. D.W.R.'s \r\nopposite, favorable conclusion.  In such a case, as noted \r\nabove, the evidence of record falls at least in relative \r\nequipoise, and therefore, the veteran will receive the \r\nbenefit of the doubt in his favor.   \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a lumbar strain is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nWAYNE M.

Walker, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from June 1968 to June \r\n1973, including honorable service in the Republic of Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an April 2005 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nNashville, Tennessee, which denied the benefit sought on \r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nA Board decision was issued in April 2006 remanding the claim \r\nto provide the veteran with a Travel Board hearing.  The \r\nhearing was held in July 2006 and a transcript of that \r\nhearing is associated with the veteran's claims file.  Thus, \r\nthe claim is now appropriately before the Board for review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran currently has post-traumatic stress disorder due \r\nto an in-service stressor.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPost-traumatic stress disorder was incurred as a result of \r\nactive service.                  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, \r\n5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that VA has substantially satisfied the \r\nduties to notify and assist, as required by the Veterans \r\nClaims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, \r\n3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a).  To the extent that there may \r\nbe any deficiency of notice or assistance, there is no \r\nprejudice to the veteran in proceeding with this appeal given \r\nthat the Board is granting in full the benefit sought on \r\nappeal.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran seeks service connection for post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder.  He contends that he suffers from amnesia, \r\nnightmares and flashbacks as a result of incidents which \r\noccurred in service.  \r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nrequires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in \r\naccordance with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a); a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service \r\nstressor; and, credible supporting evidence that the claimed \r\nin-service stressor occurred.  If the evidence establishes \r\nthat the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the \r\nclaimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of \r\nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided \r\nthat the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.304(f).  The diagnosis of a mental disorder must conform \r\nto the DSM-IV and be supported by the findings of a medical \r\nexaminer.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a).\r\n\r\nThe veteran's enlistment examination did not note any \r\npreexisting psychiatric conditions, nor was the veteran \r\ntreated for any psychiatric conditions while in service.  The \r\nservice medical records (SMRs) reflect a July 1971 treatment \r\nreport listing first and second degree burns on the veteran's \r\nleft arm, side of his neck and chest.  The examiner noted \r\nthat the veteran's injury was not due to his own misconduct, \r\nrather it occurred in the line of duty.  The treatment report \r\nconfirmed the small explosion that caused the veteran's \r\ninjuries and his subsequent transfer to the Boston Naval \r\nHospital, via Japan and San Francisco, for treatment.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a post-traumatic stress disorder \r\nscreening in August 2004 where he advised the examiner that \r\nhe had difficulty watching the news, particularly, the news \r\nof events occurring in Iraq.  He reported seeing faceless \r\ncharacters in his dreams, having difficulty sleeping, \r\nexperiencing depression and anxiety.  The examiner found the \r\nveteran's symptoms were consistent with a post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder diagnosis and assessed him as having a Global \r\nAssessment Functioning (GAF) score of 55.  In October 2004, \r\nthe veteran was officially diagnosed as having Axis I post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder pursuant to the DSM-IV.  \r\n\r\nSubsequent to his October 2004 post-traumatic stress disorder \r\ndiagnosis, the veteran underwent treatment for his post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder, which included his participation \r\nin post-traumatic stress disorder support groups at his local \r\nVAMC.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2005, the veteran underwent a VA examination and \r\nadvised the examiner of his troubled childhood and his \r\nlimited recollection of in-service incidents.  The examiner \r\nopined that the veteran did not have post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder by DSM-IV standards based upon her assessment of \r\nhim, his history, and the evaluation of his alleged \r\nstressors.  She noted that the veteran could not recall \r\nspecific stressors to substantiate a post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder diagnosis.  Further, the examiner noted that the \r\nveteran's \"antisocial traits [are] not service connected[,] \r\nrather a gradual evolution from childhood.\"  She noted that \r\nthe veteran's social and economic circumstances are \r\ninconsistent with a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis \r\nwhen reviewed in light of his psychiatric history and current \r\nmental status.  The examiner rendered no Axis I diagnosis and \r\ndiagnosed the veteran as having antisocial traits under Axis \r\nII.  She assessed the veteran's GAF at 70.  Ultimately, the \r\nexaminer opined that \"this veteran's psychosocial functional \r\nstatus and quality of life following military trauma exposure \r\n[were] not impaired by symptoms of PTSD.  He [did] have \r\nsymptoms of major depression and antisocial traits.\"  \r\n\r\nIn January 2006, the veteran's VA physician noted \r\ndisagreement with the examiner's opinion from the May 2005 VA \r\nexamination.  Thus the physician referenced the veteran's \r\nDSM-IV Axis I diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and \r\nexplained that the veteran's difficulty in recollecting his \r\nin-service stressors was due to traumatic amnesia.  The \r\nphysician further noted that traumatic amnesia is a typical \r\nsymptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.  During this \r\ntreatment, the veteran recalled the explosion in which he was \r\ninjured, and another incident involving threats made by other \r\nservice members to him due to racial tensions.  During this \r\nincident, the veteran avoided the threatening situation \r\nbecause he was still armed with his gun.  The physician added \r\nthat the veteran re-experienced in-service events in the form \r\nof nightmares and exposure distress.  He also experienced \r\navoidance such as, avoiding war news, socially isolating \r\nhimself, lacking interest in activities he previously enjoyed \r\nand experiencing traumatic amnesia.  The veteran also had \r\nsymptoms of hyperarousal manifested by insomnia, poor \r\nconcentration, irritability, being easily startled and \r\nhypervigilance.  Thus, the physician opined that after \r\n\"review of the [veteran's] intake, psychological testing, \r\nand subsequent [treatment] notes, [the veteran's] \r\nsymptomatology fully meets the criteria for a ptsd \r\ndiagnosis.\"  \r\n\r\nIn July 2006, he testified that he had little recollection of \r\nhis service in Vietnam, but that he remembered his hand and \r\narm catching fire due to a machine explosion.  He recalled \r\nhelping a fellow service member, who had also caught on fire, \r\nby throwing him in the mud to extinguish the fire.  After \r\nhelping his fellow service member, the veteran planted his \r\nhand and arm into the mud to extinguish the fire on his own \r\nbody.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran testified that within a year or two after \r\ndischarge from service, he was taken to a mental hospital for \r\nsitting on his front porch with a shotgun.  At the time the \r\nveteran had hallucinations in the form of uniformed and \r\nfaceless people walking through vegetation with a likeness to \r\nthat of the Vietnamese jungle.  The veteran recalled being \r\nhospitalized for 30 to 60 days after this incident.  \r\nAdditionally, he testified to seeing shadows behind him.  \r\n\r\nIn February 2007, the veteran submitted a statement from a \r\nfellow service member.  This service member recalled \r\nwitnessing two service members being badly burned when a \r\n\"steam jenny\" exploded.  He noted that these two service \r\nmembers were taken to Da Nang and never seen again.  \r\n\r\nIt is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to \r\nadminister the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, \r\nhowever, with the facts shown in every case.  When, after \r\ncareful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a \r\nreasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree \r\nof disability, or any other point, such doubt will be \r\nresolved in favor of the claimant.  By reasonable doubt is \r\nmeant one which exists because of an approximate balance of \r\npositive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily \r\nprove or disprove the claim.  It is a substantial doubt and \r\none within the range of probability as distinguished from \r\npure speculation or remote possibility.  See 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.102.\r\n\r\nGiven the evidence as outlined above, the Board finds that \r\nthe veteran experienced a traumatic event while stationed in \r\nthe Republic of Vietnam.  Consistent with the veteran's \r\ntestimony, the SMRs and the statement from a fellow service \r\nmember recounted a machine explosion igniting the veteran's \r\narm, chest and side of neck with fire.  The evidence further \r\nshows that the veteran was flown to the Boston Naval Hospital \r\nby way of Japan and San Francisco for medical treatment of \r\nhis burns.  This evidence is corroborative of the alleged \r\nstressor when considered in light of the circumstances of the \r\nveteran's service.  Thus, the diagnosis of post-traumatic \r\nstress disorder by the veteran's treating physician and \r\nsocial worker is determined to be a diagnosis based upon a \r\nconfirmed in-service stressor.  Although the VA examining \r\npsychologist did not render an Axis I diagnosis of post-\r\ntraumatic stress disorder in March 2005, the Board finds that \r\nthe evidence is at least in relative equipoise and reasonable \r\ndoubt should be resolved in the veteran's favor.  The medical \r\npersonnel who have treated the veteran for years agree that \r\nhe meets criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder based upon an in- service event.  Therefore, service \r\nconnection for post-traumatic stress disorder is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is \r\ngranted, subject to the laws and regulations governing \r\nmonetary awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nM.

Boorstein, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty in the United States Army \r\nfrom August 1965 to October 1976.  The veteran received a \r\nPurple Heart and is a Vietnam Era veteran.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a July 2004 rating decision of the \r\nTiger Team at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO) located in Cleveland, Ohio.  Thereafter, \r\nthe veteran's claims file was returned to his local RO in \r\nHouston, Texas.  \r\n\r\nIn October 2007, the veteran testified at a personal hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge.  A \r\ntranscript of the hearing is of record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran served in combat in the Republic of Vietnam, \r\nand is in receipt of the Purple Heart Medal and Combat \r\nInfantry Badge.\r\n\r\n2. There is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence as to whether the veteran has PTSD due to his combat \r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving doubt in favor of the veteran, PTSD was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & \r\nSupp. 2006); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the Veterans Claims Assistance Act \r\nof 2000, 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100 et. seq.  (West 2002), including \r\nthe notice and assistance requirements of Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006) and Kent v. Nicholson, 20 \r\nVet. App. 1 (2006).  Given the favorable outcome below, \r\nhowever, no prejudice to the veteran could result from any \r\ndeficiencies in VA satisfying its duties under the VCAA.  See \r\nBernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 393 (1993).\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002).  Service connection may be \r\ngranted for any disease diagnosed after service when all the \r\nevidence establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence \r\ndiagnosing the condition in accordance with \ufffd 4.125(a), of \r\nthis chapter, a link, established by medical evidence, \r\nbetween current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f). If the evidence \r\nestablishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy \r\nand the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the \r\nabsence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and \r\nprovided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the \r\ncircumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's \r\nservice, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe type of evidence required to establish that the claimed \r\nin-service stressors actually occurred depends on whether the \r\nveteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  Section \r\n1154(b) requires that the veteran have actually participated \r\nin combat with the enemy, meaning participated in events \r\nconstituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe \r\nor hostile unit or instrumentality, and does not apply to \r\nveterans who served in a general \"combat area\" or \"combat \r\nzone\" but did not themselves engage in combat with the \r\nenemy.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).  The General \r\nCounsel also indicated that the determination of whether a \r\nveteran engaged in combat with the enemy necessarily must be \r\nmade on a case-by-case basis, and that absence from a \r\nveteran's service records of any ordinary indicators of \r\ncombat service may, in appropriate cases, support a \r\nreasonable inference that the veteran did not engage in \r\ncombat; such absence may properly be considered \"negative \r\nevidence\" even though it does not affirmatively show that \r\nthe veteran did not engage in combat.  Id.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran asserts that service connection is warranted for \r\nPTSD based upon his combat service in the Republic of Vietnam \r\nduring the Vietnam era.  The veteran received a Purple Heart \r\nmedal and Combat Infantry Badge, and he received wounds \r\nconsistent with combat.  Thus, any assertions made by him \r\nregarding stressors related to that combat are presumed as \r\nhaving occurred.\r\n\r\nThe Board must next determine whether the veteran has a \r\ncurrent diagnosis of PTSD and whether there is a sufficient \r\nlink between the diagnosis and the stressors.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the record contains multiple medical opinions \r\nwhich address whether the veteran has PTSD and whether it is \r\nrelated to service.  It is the responsibility of the Board to \r\nweigh the evidence, including the medical evidence, and \r\ndetermine where to give credit and where to withhold the same \r\nand, in so doing, the Board may accept one medical opinion \r\nand reject others.  Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 \r\n(1998), citing Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). \r\nThe Board is mindful that we cannot make our own independent \r\nmedical determinations, and that we must have plausible \r\nreasons, based upon medical evidence in the record, for \r\nfavoring one medical opinion over another.  See Rucker v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997), citing Colvin v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).  Thus, the weight to be \r\naccorded the various items of evidence in this case must be \r\ndetermined by the quality of the evidence, and not \r\nnecessarily by its quantity or source.\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that the veteran was referred by VA for a \r\npsychological examination from a private provider in May \r\n2003.  At this examination, after discussing and noting the \r\nveteran's service-related injuries, the examiner discussed \r\nthe veteran's reported symptoms, including increased \r\nnightmares and flashbacks associated with experiences in \r\nVietnam, and then diagnosed the veteran with PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe veteran also received a VA examination in February 2004.  \r\nHe denied persistently re-experiencing events during the war, \r\ndistressing dreams, flashbacks, avoidance of cues, or poor \r\nsleep.  At this examination, he received a score of 70 on the \r\nMississippi scale for combat related post-traumatic stress \r\ndisorder, which, according to the examiner, indicated that \r\nthe veteran was well-adjusted.  The examiner did not diagnose \r\nPTSD.\r\n\r\nIn early June 2006, a VA psychiatrist noted that the veteran \r\nhad some of the symptoms of PTSD, such as nightmares and \r\nintrusive thoughts, and noted an assessment of rule out PTSD.  \r\nLater in June 2006, another VA psychologist determined that \r\nthe veteran did not qualify for a diagnosis of PTSD as he did \r\nnot exhibit various symptoms of PTSD.  However, in May 2007, \r\nthe veteran was again given a diagnosis of PTSD by another VA \r\npsychiatrist.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the record has contradictory information \r\nregarding whether the veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\nHowever, the credible and competent evidence of record \r\nappears to at least be in equipoise as to whether the veteran \r\nhas PTSD related to his service in Vietnam.  Thus, resolving \r\nall reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran, the Board finds \r\nthat the claim of service connection for PTSD is granted.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for post-traumatic stress disorder is \r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL LANE\r\nActing Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "60b60661f8611168dd279ca2", "name": "0921628.txt", "plainText": "Citation Nr: 0921628\t\r\nDecision Date: 06/09/09    Archive Date: 06/16/09\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  09-02 382\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a pulmonary disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tVeterans of Foreign Wars of \r\nthe United States\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nC. Lawson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1951 to June \r\n1955, with service aboard the U.S.S. ALSTEDE (AF 48) from \r\nDecember 1953 to March 1955.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an April 2008 rating determination of \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) \r\nin St. Petersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2008).  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has pleural plaques on chest x-ray that are \r\nrelated to in-service asbestos exposure.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for multiple areas of \r\npleural thickening with associated calcification are met.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating \r\na claim for VA benefits are found at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, \r\n5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2008); 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2008).  As the \r\nclaim has been granted, no further notification or assistance \r\nis necessary, and deciding the appeal is not prejudicial to \r\nthe Veteran.\r\n\r\nService personnel records show that the Veteran served aboard \r\nthe U.S.S. ALSTEDE (AF48) from December 1953 to March 1955.  \r\nA ship history of record shows that it underwent an overhaul \r\nat Bethlehem Steel yard at Staten Island, N.Y. from January \r\n21, 1955 until March 22, 1955.  \r\n\r\nService medical records do not show respiratory problems and \r\na VA respiratory evaluation and chest X-ray were normal in \r\nApril 1956.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was born in November 1932 and when he was 74, a \r\nprivate physician, S. Nihalani, M.D., stated that he had \r\npleural plaques on chest X-ray consistent with prior asbestos \r\nexposure.  The Veteran was diagnosed as having multiple areas \r\nof pleural thickening with associated calcification.\r\n\r\nIn May 2008, the Veteran indicated that he had been a meat \r\ncutter all of his working life.  During service, he stated \r\nthat his general quarters station had been as a gunmount hot \r\nshellman where he was required to wear asbestos gloves to \r\nkeep from being burned.  Also, he reported that his ship had \r\nto go to the shipyard for repair for about 4 months, and \r\nduring that time, many of the piping systems were taken \r\napart, which resulted in asbestos dust all over the ship.  He \r\nfelt that consequently, he had had more than minimal exposure \r\nto asbestos during service.  He stated that the only exposure \r\nhe had had in his life to asbestos was while he was in the \r\nNavy.  His service representative indicated in February 2009 \r\nthat the Veteran's ship was steam powered, and as such, the \r\npipes which were wrapped and taped with asbestos ran \r\nthroughout the ship to include on the decks where the sailors \r\ntook their meals and in the spaces where they slept.  \r\n\r\nIn light of the evidence, the Board concludes that service \r\nconnection is warranted for asbestosis.  It is more likely \r\nthan not that the Veteran was exposed to asbestos in service \r\nbased on the statements of record.  He has been diagnosed as \r\nhaving pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos \r\nexposure.  There is no competent medical evidence of record \r\nrefuting this finding.  The Veteran has also indicated that \r\nhe has never been exposed to asbestos, except in the Navy.  \r\nTherefore, the Board finds that \r\nservice connection for multiple areas of  pleural thickening \r\nwith associated calcification is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for multiple areas of pleural thickening \r\nwith associated calcification is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nP.

Fields, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1989 to \r\nDecember 1992.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an April 2005 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO), in \r\nSt. Petersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nThis matter was previously before the Board in December 2007 \r\nand August 2008 at which time it was remanded for additional \r\ndevelopment.  It is now returned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his \r\nfatigue is due to an undiagnosed illness, has existed for at \r\nleast six months, and has manifested to a degree of at least \r\n10 percent following service in the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for \r\nfatigue, including as due to an undiagnosed illness, have \r\nbeen met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1117, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304, 3.317 \r\n(2008). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs the Board's decision herein constitutes a complete grant \r\nof the benefit sought on appeal, no further action is \r\nrequired to comply with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that he is entitled to service connection \r\nfor chronic fatigue, to include as a qualifying chronic \r\ndisability under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317.  He asserts that he began \r\nto experience symptoms of fatigue shortly after returning \r\nfrom service in the Persian Gulf War.  The Board notes that \r\nthe record reflects that the Veteran served in the Southwest \r\nAsia Theater of operations from October 1990 to April 1991.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  Where a disease is \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, service connection may be granted \r\nwhen all of the evidence, including that pertinent to \r\nservice, establishes that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nIf a chronic disease is shown in service, subsequent \r\nmanifestations of the same disease at any later date, however \r\nremote, may be service connected, unless clearly attributable \r\nto intercurrent causes.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  However, \r\ncontinuity of symptoms is required where a condition in \r\nservice is noted but is not, in fact, chronic or where a \r\ndiagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  Id.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, to establish entitlement to \"direct\" service \r\nconnection for a claimed disability, there must be medical \r\nevidence of a current disability; medical or, in certain \r\ncircumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a \r\nnexus between the current disability and the in-service \r\ndisease or injury.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304; \r\nsee also Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512 (2004).\r\n\r\nAs the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia Theater of \r\nOperations during the Persian Gulf War, service connection \r\nmay also be established under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1117 and 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.317.  Under these provisions, compensation may be \r\npaid to a Persian Gulf Veteran who exhibits objective \r\nindications of a qualifying chronic disability that became \r\nmanifest during active duty service in the Southwest Asia \r\ntheater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a \r\ndegree of 10 percent or more prior to December 31, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe term \"qualifying chronic disability\" means a chronic \r\ndisability resulting from (A) an undiagnosed illness, (B) a \r\nmedically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness that is \r\ndefined by a cluster of signs or symptoms (such as chronic \r\nfatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or irritable bowel syndrome), \r\nor (C), any diagnosed illness that the Secretary determines \r\nin regulations prescribed under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1117(d) \r\nwarrants a presumption of service connection.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n1117(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317(a)(2)(i).  \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this section, a chronic disability is one \r\nthat existed for six months or more, including a disability \r\nthat exhibits intermittent episodes of improvement and \r\nworsening over a six-month period.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317(a)(3).  \r\n\r\n\"Objective indications\" of chronic disability include both \r\n\"signs,\" in a medical sense of objective evidence \r\nperceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical \r\nindicators that are capable of independent verification.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.317(a)(3).  Signs or symptoms which may be \r\nmanifestations of undiagnosed illness or medically \r\nunexplained chronic multisymptom illness include, but are not \r\nlimited to: fatigue, signs or symptoms involving the skin, \r\nheadache, muscle or joint pain, neurologic signs or symptoms, \r\nneuropsychological signs or symptoms, signs or symptoms \r\ninvolving the upper or lower respiratory system, \r\ngastrointestinal signs or symptoms, cardiovascular signs or \r\nsymptoms, abnormal weight loss, or menstrual disorders.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1117(g); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317(b).  \r\n\r\nAn undiagnosed illness is defined as a condition that cannot \r\nbe attributed to any known clinical diagnosis based on \r\nhistory, physical examination, or laboratory tests. 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.317(a)(1)(i)).  Unlike claims for \"direct\" service \r\nconnection, there is no requirement that there be competent \r\nevidence of a nexus between a claimed undiagnosed illness and \r\nservice.  Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 8-9 (2004).  \r\nFurthermore, lay persons are competent to report objective \r\nsigns of illness.  Id.  To determine whether an undiagnosed \r\nillness is manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more the \r\ncondition must be rated by analogy to a disease or injury in \r\nwhich the functions affected, anatomical location or \r\nsymptomatology are similar.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317(a)(5); see \r\nalso Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe term \"medically unexplained chronic multisymptom \r\nillness\" means a diagnosed illness without conclusive \r\npathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by \r\noverlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as \r\nfatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical \r\nfindings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory \r\nabnormalities.  Chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially \r\nunderstood etiology and pathophysiology will not be \r\nconsidered medically unexplained.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.317(a)(2)(ii).\r\n\r\nThere are currently no diagnosed illnesses that have been \r\ndetermined by the Secretary to warrant a presumption of \r\nservice connection under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317(a)(2)(C).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran's service treatment records reflect \r\nno complaints or treatment for fatigue during service.  As \r\nnoted above, he claims that he began experiencing fatigue \r\nbegan shortly after returning from the Persian Gulf.  The \r\nBoard notes that he did not report of fatigue in a February \r\n1993 VA general medical examination.  However, the Veteran \r\nstates that he reported experiencing fatigue, among other \r\nsymptoms, since returning from the Persian Gulf during an \r\nApril 1994 examination for the Persian Gulf War registry.  \r\nSee, e.g., December 2008 statement.  The record reflects that \r\nsuch an examination was conducted, see, e.g., list of \r\nappointments from Temple VA, but the examination report is \r\nnot in the claims file.  It appears that such evidence is not \r\navailable, as it was not provided in response to a November \r\n2008 request for such information.  \r\n\r\nIn February 1997, the Veteran and his wife reported to a \r\nprivate physician that he had been sleepy and fatigued for \r\napproximately four years, or since approximately 1993, \r\ndespite apparently sleeping enough at night.  He was \r\ndiagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.  See Scott & \r\nWhite records.  In July 2005, the Veteran reported to a VA \r\nphysician that he had been sleepy all day for 15 years.  He \r\nstated that he was very tired throughout the day despite \r\nusing an overnight CPAP breathing device for the last five \r\nyears to treat his sleep apnea.  See VA records.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been provided with several VA examinations \r\nduring the course of these proceedings.  In February 2005, he \r\nwas provided with an examination under Gulf War guidelines.  \r\nAt that time, he reported having chronic fatigue and daytime \r\nsleepiness since returning from the Persian Gulf.  The VA \r\nexaminer opined that such symptoms may well be due to the \r\nVeteran's history of sleep apnea, requiring CPAP treatment, \r\nand his reported feelings of depression.\r\n\r\nIn March 2005, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination \r\nconcerning his sleep apnea.  The VA examiner opined that the \r\nVeteran's continued fatigue may be related either to \r\nuncontrolled sleep apnea, despite treatment with a CPAP \r\nbreathing device, or another condition such as chronic \r\nfatigue syndrome.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, a VA examiner reviewed the Veteran's records \r\nand rendered an opinion as to the source of his fatigue.  The \r\nVA examiner noted prior diagnoses of sleep apnea, treated \r\nwith a CPAP breathing device, and posttraumatic stress \r\ndisorder (PTSD).  He further noted that there was no \r\ndiagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome.  The examiner opined \r\nthat, based on a review of the treatment records, the \r\nVeteran's symptoms of fatigue are likely manifestations of \r\nhis sleep apnea, PTSD, and medications to treat PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was provided with another VA examination in \r\nFebruary 2009.  The Veteran reported that overnight use of \r\nthe CPAP machine was helping but that he still got tired \r\naround noon every day.  He stated that his tiredness goes \r\naway about half of the time, but it stays about the same half \r\nof the time and he falls asleep early after work on those \r\ndays.  The Veteran further reported that he had been \r\ndiagnosed with PTSD in approximately 2003 and had been \r\ntreated with medications and counseling for about five \r\nmonths.  He stated that this seemed to help, but he stopped \r\ntaking medications because he felt drugged when he was \r\nprescribed an increased dose.  The Veteran agreed that he was \r\ndepressed in 2003, but he stated that he felt fine now and \r\ndoubted that he was still depressed.  The VA examiner opined \r\nthat the Veteran did not meet the criteria for chronic \r\nfatigue syndrome.  He further opined that the Veteran's \r\ntiredness could have no explanation, but it may be due to his \r\nPTSD or his sleep apnea.  However, the examiner stated that \r\nthe Veteran may not have PTSD anymore and he did not have \r\nenough expertise concerning sleep apnea to know the tiredness \r\nwas linked to that condition.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the \r\nVeteran's fatigue has not been attributed to a known clinical \r\ndiagnosis.  The Board notes that the Veteran is service \r\nconnected for sleep apnea, but his service connection claim \r\nfor PTSD has been denied.  Although the various VA examiners \r\nopined that the Veteran's fatigue may be due to his sleep \r\napnea or his PTSD, none of these opinions is specific enough \r\nto attribute the fatigue to these conditions.  As such, \r\nresolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the \r\nBoard finds that the evidence of record establishes that his \r\nfatigue is due to an undiagnosed illness.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the record reflects that the Veteran's fatigue \r\nis chronic for the purposes of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317 and \r\nmanifested to a degree of at least 10 percent following \r\nservice.  Specifically, the Veteran has consistently reported \r\nthat he been fatigued since the early 1990s after returning \r\nfrom the Persian Gulf.  He has further reported that he \r\nexperiences tiredness throughout the day at least half of the \r\ntime and that he goes to sleep early after work on those \r\ndays.  These symptoms persist despite use of a CPAP machine \r\nto treat his sleep apnea, no longer feeling depressed, and \r\nstopping use of medications for PTSD. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, as the evidence of record establishes that the \r\nVeteran's fatigue is chronic, due to an undiagnosed illness, \r\nand manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more after \r\nservice in the Persian Gulf, he is entitled to service \r\nconnection for such disability under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.317.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for fatigue is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDEMETRIOS G.

Jaeger, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from March 1946 to February \r\n1948.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in December \r\n2006 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2008).  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, \r\ntinnitus is caused by acoustic trauma during active military \r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nTinnitus was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, \r\n5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs the Board's decision to grant service connection for \r\ntinnitus herein constitutes a complete grant of the benefit \r\nsought on appeal, no further action is required to comply \r\nwith the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 and the \r\nimplementing regulations. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that while he was serving aboard the \r\nU.S.S. Bremerton as an electronics technician mate, he was \r\nexposed to the firing of heavy guns during training missions.  \r\nSpecifically, he alleges that his duty location, the \r\nelectronic repair shack, was located on the main deck just \r\naft of the second forward gun turret.  The Veteran claims \r\nthat he was not provided hearing protection as such was not \r\nissued to any members of the crew who were not part of the \r\ngunnery team.  He argues that, since his in-service exposure \r\nto acoustic trauma, he has continuously experienced tinnitus.  \r\nThe Veteran, therefore, contends that service connection is \r\nwarranted for such disorder.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  Service \r\nconnection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed \r\nafter discharge, when all of the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nDirect service connection may not be granted without medical \r\nevidence of a current disability; medical or, in certain \r\ncircumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a \r\nnexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and \r\nthe present disease or injury.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1112; 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.304.  See also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 \r\n(1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) [(table)].\r\n\r\nAlternatively, service connection may be established under 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) the existence of a \r\nchronic disease in service or during an applicable \r\npresumption period under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307 and (ii) present \r\nmanifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) when a \r\nchronic disease is not present during service, evidence of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology. \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding any issue material to the determination of \r\na matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt \r\nto the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; see \r\nalso Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  \r\n\r\nThe Board initially notes that the record reflects a current \r\ndiagnosis of tinnitus.  Specifically, although tinnitus is \r\nreadily observable by laypersons and does not require medical \r\nexpertise to establish its existence, see Charles v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002), such diagnosis has been \r\nconfirmed by a VA audiologist in a July 2006 treatment record \r\nand the Veteran's private physician, Dr. Garell, in a July \r\n2007 statement. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records are negative for \r\ncomplaints, treatment, or diagnoses relevant to tinnitus.  \r\nHowever, the Board finds that the Veteran has offered \r\ncompetent and credible statements detailing his in-service \r\nnoise exposure.  \r\nSpecifically, his contention that he was exposed to excessive \r\nnoise during his military service while serving aboard a \r\nheavy cruiser on a training mission is consistent with his \r\nduty title of electronics technician mate and his service \r\naboard the U.S.S. Bremerton as noted on his Notice of \r\nSeparation from the U.S. Naval Service.  Therefore, despite \r\nthe fact that the record is void of documentation of \r\ncomplaints or treatment for tinnitus during service, the \r\nVeteran is competent to describe the nature and extent of his \r\nin-service noise exposure.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(2); \r\nWashington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); Layno \r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the record reflects that the Veteran has \r\npresented competent and credible evidence of continuity of \r\nsymptomatology since his military service.  In this regard, \r\nthe Veteran has stated in multiple documents submitted during \r\nthe course of his appeal that he has experienced tinnitus, \r\ndescribed as a constant hissing noise in both ears, since his \r\nservice discharge.  Additionally, in a July 2007 statement, \r\nthe Veteran's wife indicated that he had complained about \r\ntinnitus for the length of their marriage.  Also in a July \r\n2007 statement, the Veteran's co-worker of 20 years reported \r\nthat he complained on frequent occasions that he suffered \r\nfrom a ringing and buzzing in his ear identified as tinnitus \r\nand that such was first noticeable when he was in the \r\nservice. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in a July 2007 statement, Dr. Garell reported \r\nthat the Veteran had claimed that he suffers from tinnitus \r\nsince his service in the U.S. Navy and opined that, the \r\ncircumstances that he described, specifically acoustic trauma \r\ndue to the firing of heavy weapons without the protection of \r\near plugs, could have caused such a condition.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, while Dr. Garell couched his opinion in \r\nspeculative terms, there is no contrary opinion of record.  \r\nMoreover, in light of the competent and credible evidence \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology, the Board resolves all \r\nreasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and concludes that \r\ntinnitus was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, \r\n5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for tinnitus is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nC.

Richard Rasmussen, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from February 1969 to \r\nDecember 1970.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an August 2005 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nIndianapolis, Indiana.\r\n\r\nIn April 2009, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for \r\nadditional development.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nIt is as likely as not that the Veteran has a right wrist \r\nnon-union fracture of the scaphoid that is attributable to \r\nhis active military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has a right wrist non-union fracture of the \r\nscaphoid that is the result of injury incurred during active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn a February 2005 statement, the Veteran contends that his \r\ncurrent right hand or wrist disability is related to his \r\nactive military service.  Specifically, he attributes his \r\ndisability to a 1970 incident in Vietnam in which his right \r\nhand was caught in the hatch of a M114 Command and \r\nReconnaissance Carrier, resulting in a fracture that required \r\nthree days of treatment and one week of being in a splint.  \r\nIn addition, in a May 2005 statement, the Veteran contends \r\nthat, while in tank training at Fort Knox during 1969, his \r\nvehicle drove under a low hanging tree branch at night, \r\ncausing the branch to strike and injure his right hand and \r\narm, resulting in treatment at the Ireland Army Hospital.  \r\nThus, the Veteran contends that service connection is \r\nwarranted for residuals of a right wrist and hand injury.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated \r\nby, active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304 (2009).  In general, service \r\nconnection requires medical evidence of a current disability; \r\nmedical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of \r\nincurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; \r\nand medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-\r\nservice injury or disease and current disability.  Hickson v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 247, 252 (1999).\r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's post-service medical records \r\nreveals that he has received treatment for pain in his right \r\nwrist.  November 2004 and December 2004 treatment records \r\nfrom the Louisville VA Medical Center (VAMC) indicate that \r\nthe Veteran sought treatment for pain in both wrists and pain \r\nin his right hand.  February 2005 x-ray results from the \r\nLouisville VAMC indicate an old nonunion right navicular \r\nfracture and a probable old traumatic change of the right \r\ntriquetrum.  In addition, July 2005 treatment records from \r\nKleinert Kutz Hand Care Center indicate that the Veteran has \r\nbeen diagnosed with degenerative osteoarthritis of the right \r\nwrist.  \r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's service treatment records reveals \r\nthat the Veteran had no diagnosis of or treatment for a right \r\nhand or wrist injury in service.  The Veteran's December 1970 \r\nseparation examination report indicates that the Veteran's \r\nupper extremities were in normal condition.  However, the \r\nVeteran's military occupational specialty was as a medical \r\nspecialist and, at a January 2008 hearing, the Veteran stated \r\nthat he treated himself after his injury in Vietnam.  Hearing \r\nTranscript at 4-5.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2009, pursuant to the Board's April 2009 remand, the \r\nVeteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with this \r\nclaim.  The examiner reviewed the claims file and examined \r\nthe Veteran.  At the examination, the Veteran reported that, \r\nin 1969 while training at Ft. Knox, his right wrist was \r\ntrapped between a tank and a tree limb which caused bruising \r\nand in 1970 while in Vietnam, a steel door fell on his right \r\nhand which caused swelling-the Veteran treated himself with \r\nmorphine and received a cast two months later.  The Veteran \r\nfurther reported that he received treatment for wrist pain \r\nafter service but the records of that treatment are no longer \r\navailable.  An x-ray report reviewed at the examination \r\nindicated an old fracture of the scaphoid with nonunion.  The \r\nexaminer diagnosed the Veteran with right old scaphoid \r\nfracture with nonunion and opined that the \"right hand or \r\nwrist disability is due to or a result of the [Veteran's] \r\nperiod of active military service.\"  The examiner reasoned \r\nthat:\r\n\r\nThe [Veteran] describes the injury that \r\nhe sustained while catching a steel, \r\n200[-pound] hatch door as an axial \r\nloading injury and reports symptoms \r\nfollowing his injury consistent with a \r\nfracture-swelling, pain, inability to us \r\nhis wrist to eat, etc.  While there is no \r\nevidence in the [service treatment \r\nrecords] to document the event, the \r\n[Veteran] was [a] medic and had the \r\ncapacity to self treat (i.e., pain \r\nmanagement with morphine).  The lack of \r\nimmobilization and respective treatment \r\nfor the fracture is consistent with an \r\nend result of nonunion of the fracture.  \r\nThe [Veteran's] supportive letter by [his \r\nfriend]. . . states that \"he has had \r\nproblems with [his] right wrist and hand \r\n[ever] since I have know him . . .\" and \r\nthat \"I have known [the Veteran] since \r\n1971.\"  Although the [Veteran's] \r\nseparation exam is reported as normal \r\njoints, it doesn't include the usual, \r\ndetailed review of symptoms.  Again \r\naccording to all [x-rays], the fracture \r\nis old, although a definit[]e time of \r\ninjury is not applicable per [x-ray].\r\n\r\nIn summary, there is no definitive \r\nevidence to document an injury to the \r\n[Veteran's] right wrist during active \r\nduty, the history described by the \r\n[Veteran], the extenuating circumstances \r\nsurrounding the injury, the results of \r\nlack of treatment, the [x-ray] findings, \r\nthe letters of support for the Veteran \r\nall are consistent with injury described, \r\nand therefore it is my opinion that it is \r\nas least as likely as not that his \r\nscaphoid nonunion is caused by an injury \r\nthat he sustained while on active duty.\r\n\r\nThus, because the Veteran is competent to report on an injury \r\nin service and continued symptoms thereafter, and because \r\nthere is no medical opinion evidence of record to contradict \r\nthe well-reasoned opinion of the July 2009 examiner, the \r\nBoard finds that service connection for the diagnosed right \r\nwrist non-union fracture of the scaphoid is warranted.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a right wrist non-union fracture of \r\nthe scaphoid is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\nMARK F.

Barner, Law Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from October 1965 to January \r\n1969.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a January 2010 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Lincoln, \r\nNebraska, which denied the benefit sought on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is causally related to in-\r\nservice noise exposure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nBilateral hearing loss was incurred in active military service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1101, 1110, 1111, 1112, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.306, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that VA has substantially satisfied the duties to \r\nnotify and assist, as required by the Veterans Claims Assistance \r\nAct of 2000 (VCAA).  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, \r\n3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2010).  To the extent that there may \r\nbe any deficiency of notice or assistance, there is no prejudice \r\nto the Veteran in proceeding with this appeal given the favorable \r\nnature of the Board's decision.  Any error in the failure to \r\nprovide notice involving the downstream elements of rating and \r\neffective date is harmless at this time, and can be corrected by \r\nthe RO following the Board's decision.  See Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  \r\nService connection may be awarded for a current disability \r\narising from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, \r\n3.304.  Service connection may also be awarded for certain \r\ndisabilities, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, \r\nwhich manifest to a compensable degree within a statutorily-\r\nprescribed period of time.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309.  As with any claim, when there is an approximate \r\nbalance of positive and negative evidence regarding any matter \r\nmaterial to the claim, the claimant shall be given the benefit-\r\nof-the-doubt.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107. \r\n\r\nFor the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired \r\nhearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in \r\nany of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 \r\ndecibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least \r\nthree of the above frequencies are 26 decibels or higher; or when \r\nspeech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less \r\nthan 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385.  Use of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385 to \r\ndefine a disability under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 as it pertains to \r\nhearing loss has been recognized by the Court as a reasonable \r\ninterpretation of the statute.  See Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 \r\nVet. App. 174 (2007).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss due to \r\nhis active military service.  Specifically, the Veteran reported \r\nexposure to noisy aircraft while operating in-service as a \r\nloadmaster in the cargo department.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's September 1965 service enlistment examination noted \r\nthe Veteran's ears were normal.  At that time an audiogram \r\nrevealed puretone thresholds, in decibels (dB), as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\nRIGHT\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\nLEFT\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n-5\r\n\r\nIn December 1966, the Veteran reported having an upper \r\nrespiratory infection and resulting problem clearing his ears \r\nduring a flight's descent.  His hearing examination was noted to \r\nbe okay bilaterally; however, the valsava ear clearing maneuver \r\nindicated a slow right ear response, and sluggish left ear \r\nresponse.  A January 1969 separation examination indicated the \r\nVeteran's ears were generally normal, as was the valsava \r\nmaneuver.  His audiogram at this time revealed puretone \r\nthresholds, in dB, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\nRIGHT\r\n15\r\n15\r\n15\r\n20\r\n15\r\nLEFT\r\n15\r\n15\r\n15\r\n15\r\n15\r\n\r\nIn November 2009, the Veteran's physical examination revealed \r\nsignificant hearing loss, and the examiner opined that it was \r\n\"undoubtedly related to his history of flying 2700 hours in \r\nnoisy, unpressurized cockpits during his military service.\"  The \r\nexaminer noted that the Veteran was particularly affected by high \r\nfrequency sounds, and would be sent for a hearing evaluation.  \r\n\r\nIn November 2009, the Veteran was seen for evaluation at The \r\nHearing Clinic, Inc.  At that time he complained of hearing loss, \r\nparticularly difficulty understanding conversations in the \r\npresence of crowds.  The audiologist reviewed some of the \r\nVeteran's service and military records.  The Veteran reported in-\r\nservice noise exposure from loud C-124 cargo planes, without the \r\nuse of hearing protection.  Since service, the Veteran denied \r\nexposure to any significant noise, ear pain, drainage, rapidly \r\nprogressive hearing loss, balance or dizziness problems, or \r\nsensitivity to loud sounds.  On examination his tympanic \r\nmembranes and ear canals were clear bilaterally.  Speech \r\naudiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent \r\nbilaterally.  The examiner noted that audiology results indicated \r\na mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss.  The examiner \r\nconcluded that it was quite likely that the noise exposure the \r\nVeteran suffered during service was the beginning of his hearing \r\nloss, because the type and degree of his hearing loss was \r\nconsistent with being noise induced.  An audiogram and Maryland \r\nCNC test reflect a current disability as defined by VA at \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385 for hearing loss.\r\nWith respect to in-service injury, the Veteran asserts that as a \r\nloadmaster he was exposed to noisy, uninsulated, unpressurized \r\naircraft for 2700 hours of flight time.  Although the Veteran is \r\na layperson, he is competent to testify regarding the \r\ncircumstances of his service, and observable difficulty incurred \r\ntherein.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to \r\nsupport presence of disability even where not corroborated by \r\ncontemporaneous medical evidence).  Because there is an equipoise \r\nof the evidence, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor \r\nof the Veteran, and finds that the available evidence supports \r\nthe conclusion that the bilateral hearing loss was incurred in \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Board finds the evidence of record supports \r\nservice connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.  As \r\na preponderance of the evidence supports the award of service \r\nconnection, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is applicable in \r\nthe instant appeal.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); Ortiz v. \r\nPrincipi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert at 55-57 \r\n(1991).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted, subject \r\nto the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary \r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nTHOMAS D.

As there has been substantial compliance with the \r\nBoard's remand order with regard to the AMC's attempt to obtain \r\nthe Veteran's records and the Veteran has been provided with an \r\nadditional VA examination, no further action is required.  See \r\nDyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999); Stegall v. West, \r\n11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  The matter was returned to the Board in \r\nOctober 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran presented testimony at the RO before a Decision \r\nReview Officer in May 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's currently diagnosed lower back disorder began \r\nduring his active military service. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lower \r\nback disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107 (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has \r\na duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim \r\nfor VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, \r\n5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159 and \r\n3.326(a) (2010).  In this decision, the Board grants service \r\nconnection for a lower back disability.  This award represents a \r\ncomplete grant of the benefit sought on appeal.  Thus, any \r\ndeficiency in VA's compliance is deemed to be harmless error, and \r\nany further discussion of VA's responsibilities is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he injured his back in service and that \r\nthis injury is the cause of his current lower back disorder.  He \r\ntestified in May 2009 that he has experienced continuing back \r\npain ever since the initial in-service injury, and that the pain \r\nis located in the same part of his back as the pain that he \r\nexperienced during service.  \r\n\r\nService connection is established where a particular injury or \r\ndisease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty \r\nin active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was \r\naggravated during service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.303(a), 3.306.  \"[I]n order to establish service connection \r\nor service-connected aggravation for a present disability the \r\nveteran must show:  (1) the existence of a present disability; \r\n(2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; \r\nand (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and \r\nthe disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.\"  \r\nShedden v.

Cir. 2004).  \r\n\r\nA Veteran may be granted service connection for any disease \r\ninitially diagnosed after discharge, but only if all the \r\nevidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that \r\nthe disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, service connection may be established under 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) the existence of a \r\nchronic disease in service or during an applicable presumption \r\nperiod under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307 and (ii) present manifestations of \r\nthe same chronic disease, or (b) when a chronic disease is not \r\npresent during service, evidence of continuity of symptomatology. \r\n\r\nThe determination as to whether these requirements are met is \r\nbased on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the \r\nevaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. \r\nWest, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  In \r\ndetermining whether service connection is warranted for a \r\ndisability, VA is responsible for determining whether the \r\nevidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the \r\nVeteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is \r\ndenied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. \r\n49, 55 (1990).  \r\n\r\nA lay witness is competent to testify as to the occurrence of an \r\nin-service injury or incident where such issue is factual in \r\nnature.  Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  In some \r\ncases, lay evidence will also be competent and credible on the \r\nissues of diagnosis and etiology.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 \r\nF.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Specifically, lay evidence \r\nmay be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where \r\n(1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, \r\n(2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical \r\ndiagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time \r\nsupports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, \r\n492 F.3d at 1377; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 \r\n(2009).  A layperson is competent to identify a medical condition \r\nwhere the condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily \r\nidentifiable features.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 \r\n(2007).  Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay \r\nobservation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of \r\nsymptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-\r\nservice injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for \r\nsuch symptoms.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994); \r\nCharles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App 370, 374 (2002).\r\n\r\nThe competent medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran \r\nhas a currently diagnosed lower back disability.  In March 1995, \r\nthe Veteran began seeing a private chiropractor and was diagnosed \r\nwith chronic lumbar back pain.  Subsequently, in January 2006, a \r\nVA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with minimal lumbar spondylosis \r\nat L5, mild degenerative facet joints at L5-S, mild degenerative \r\ndisc disease from T4-T9, and focal spondylosis at T8-T9, with \r\nlimited range of motion and mild to severe pain.\r\n\r\nThe record also shows that the Veteran suffered a back injury in \r\nservice.  The Veteran's service treatment records show that he \r\ncomplained of low back pain in March 1984.  He reported having \r\nbeen sandwiched between other players on the basketball court and \r\ntold the treating physician that he had experienced similar \r\nproblems in October 1983.  The physician noted the presence of \r\ncontusions and no x-rays were taken.  In August 1984, the Veteran \r\ncomplained of back pain for a duration of five days and was \r\ndiagnosed with low back pain.  In July 1988, the Veteran service \r\ntreatment notes indicate that he pulled a muscle in his back.  \r\nLater that month, the Veteran was seen for chest pains, and the \r\ntreatment notes indicate that his back was tender at the \r\ncostovertebral angle.  Nothing is noted on the Veteran's \r\nseparation examination report in July 1990.\r\n\r\nThe initial post-service treatment records for low back problems \r\nare dated in March 1995, when the Veteran sought treatment from a \r\nprivate chiropractor.  At that time, the Veteran reported that \r\nhis back pain began a couple of months prior after lifting a 200 \r\npound weight.  The end of this note is either indecipherable or \r\nincomplete.  He was diagnosed with thoracic pain/lower back pain.  \r\nThe records from the Veteran's chiropractor show that he sought \r\ntreatment for back pain continuously from March 1995 to June \r\n2005.  At a May 2009 hearing, the Veteran testified that his \r\nprivate chiropractor said that his current back problems could be \r\nrelated to the injuries he suffered in service.  He also asserted \r\nthat he has experienced back pain in the same location \r\ncontinuously since service and explained that he did not seek \r\ntreatment for back pain immediately after service because his \r\nsymptoms were not severe until 1994.\r\n\r\nThere are two medical opinions of record on the relationship \r\nbetween the Veteran's in-service injury and his currently \r\ndiagnosed back disorder.  One examiner determined that the \r\nquestion of etiology could not be determined without resort to \r\nspeculation and the other determined that it was less likely than \r\nnot that the Veteran's current lower back disorder is related to \r\nhis military service.  Where there are several medical opinions \r\nof record evaluating the relationship between the Veteran's \r\ncurrent disabilities and service, it is the responsibility of the \r\nBoard to assess the credibility and weight given to the evidence.  \r\nSee Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992).  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in \r\nJanuary 2006.  The examiner reviewed the Veteran's in-service \r\ntreatment for his back in August 1984.  He stated that it was \r\nunclear if the Veteran's current condition could result from his \r\nin-service complaint of back pain because there were no \r\nradiographs or records of follow-up visits in his service \r\ntreatment records.  Therefore, the examiner was unable to \r\ndetermine the severity of the Veteran's back condition at that \r\ntime and could not resolve the issue without resort to mere \r\nspeculation.  \r\n\r\nOn remand, the Veteran was provided with a second VA examination \r\nin June 2010.  The examiner provided the opinion that it was less \r\nlikely than not that the Veteran's chronic low back had its \r\nclinical onset during service or is otherwise related to any in-\r\nservice disease or injury because there was inadequate \r\ndocumentation to relate the Veteran's current symptomatology to \r\nany in-service disease, event, or injury.\r\n\r\nThe January 2006 VA examiner's opinion is speculative and thereby \r\ninsufficient to establish the lack of a nexus between the \r\nVeteran's in-service injury and current lower back disorder.  See \r\nJones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 387-88 (2010), citing \r\nMcLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2006).  Additionally, \r\nboth the January 2006 opinion and June 2010 opinion are of little \r\nprobative value: although both examiners considered the Veteran's \r\nstatements regarding the history and nature of his in-service \r\ninjury, neither examiner considered the Veteran's testimony \r\nregarding the continuous nature of his symptoms since service.  \r\nSee Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (holding that \r\nthe VA examiner's opinion was inadequate when there was no \r\nindication as to whether the examiner considered the Veteran's \r\nassertions of continued symptomatology).  Therefore, the opinions \r\nprovided were not given in consideration of all of the relevant \r\ndata.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301-04 (2008) \r\n(holding that the Board must consider whether the examiner had \r\nsufficient facts and data and provided sufficient reasoning in \r\nassessing the probative value of a medical opinion).  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Veteran's accounts of his back injury in service \r\nand the continuous nature of his back pain since service are \r\ncredible, as the Veteran's account is corroborated by his service \r\ntreatment records, he was treated for back pain in service on \r\nmultiple occasions over a four year period, and he sought regular \r\nand continuous medical treatment for back pain beginning five \r\nyears after discharge from service.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran reported that his lower back pain happened a \r\nmonth and a half prior when lifting a 200 pound weight in a March \r\n1995 chiropractic medical history assessment and denied knowledge \r\nof any employment-related injury during that period at his June \r\n2010 examination, there is no indication in the medical record \r\nthat this injury was employment-related.  Therefore, the \r\nVeteran's credibility is not brought into question because the \r\nevidence indicates that the event he claimed to not recall did \r\nnot actually occur.  Furthermore, this notation is either \r\nincomplete or indecipherable and should not be used to discount \r\nthe Veteran's testimony in the interest of fairness.  Rather, to \r\nthe extent it is possible to discern the meaning of this partial \r\nphrase in the chiropractic treatment records, the phrase \r\n\"lifting a 200 lb weight\" seems to indicate that the injury was \r\nrelated to the Veteran's exercise regimen, and the evidence of \r\nrecord contains a statement from the Veteran's chiropractor \r\nasserting that his workouts were aggravating his spinal \r\ncondition.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, although the March 1995 treatment record could be \r\nread to say that all of the Veteran's back symptoms began a month \r\nand a half prior to March 1995, the Board finds that this \r\nstatement is consistent with the Veteran's testimony regarding \r\nthe severe worsening of his ongoing back pain in 1994, which he \r\ntestified caused him to seek treatment.  \r\n\r\nLastly, the Board notes the objections of the June 2010 VA \r\nexaminer regarding the absence of supporting medical \r\ndocumentation from the time of service, but lay evidence does not \r\nlack credibility merely because of the absence of confirmatory \r\ncontemporaneous medical records.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d \r\n1331, 1336 (2006).  Therefore, despite the appearance of any \r\ninconsistencies, the Veteran's statements regarding his injury \r\nand symptoms are consistent with the other evidence of record \r\nand, thereby, credible.   \r\n\r\nThe Veteran is competent to testify to symptoms of back pain and \r\nthe continuity of those symptoms following an in-service injury.  \r\nLayno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994); Charles v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App 370, 374 (2002).  Furthermore, the \r\nVeteran's reports of continuing back pain are corroborated by the \r\ndiagnoses provided by his chiropractor and VA examiners.  \r\nJandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  Therefore, the Board finds that (1) \r\nthe competent medical evidence of record showing a current \r\ndiagnosis of a back disorder, specifically chronic back pain and \r\nlimited motion with spondylosis and degenerative disc disease; \r\n(2) the service treatment records showing an in-service injury \r\nand continuing complaints of back pain; and (3) the Veteran's \r\ncompetent and credible testimony showing that his symptoms of \r\nback pain have been continuous since service establish that his \r\ncurrent back disorder is related to service or, at a minimum, \r\nplaces the evidence of record in relative equipoise.  \r\nAccordingly, the Board resolves any doubt in favor of the Veteran \r\nand finds that the evidence supports service connection for a \r\nlower back disorder.  The appeal is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a lower back disorder is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nP.M.

Armstrong, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from November 1956 to October 1958.  These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2008 rating decision of the Cleveland, Ohio Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran's claims file is now in the jurisdiction of the Oakland, California RO.    \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nIt is reasonably shown that the Veteran has a bilateral hearing loss disability that is causally related to his exposure to noise trauma in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nA. Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA applies to the instant claim.  However, inasmuch as the benefit sought is being granted, there is no reason to belabor the impact of the VCAA on this matter; any notice defect or duty to assist omission is harmless.  \r\n\r\n\r\nB. Legal Criteria, Factual Background, and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability due to disease or injury that was incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed disability, there must be medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nService incurrence or aggravation of organic disease of the nervous system (to include SNHL) may be presumed if such is manifested to a compensable degree within a year following a Veteran's discharge from service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309. \r\n\r\nHearing loss disability is defined by regulation.  For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385. \r\n\r\nIn Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993), the Court noted that 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385, \"does not preclude service connection for a current hearing disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service.\"  Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159.  As the Court noted in Hensley, a Veteran who displayed normal hearing acuity at service separation may nonetheless be awarded service connection for hearing loss at a later date if the medical evidence determines his/her hearing loss was the result of an in-service disease or injury.  Id. \r\n\r\nThere is conflicting medical evidence that is critical to a determination in this matter.  When evaluating this evidence, the Board must analyze its credibility and probative value, account for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the veteran.  See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.  When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that it has reviewed all of the evidence in the Veteran's claims file, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence as appropriate and the analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's DD Form-214 does not appear to specify his military occupation specialty (MOS) in service.  However, it does indicate that he completed training for YN3 and he also reported on October 2008 VA examination that he served as a ship's yeoman.  Notably, YN is the abbreviation for the Navy Yeoman rating. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs are silent for complaints, findings, treatment, or diagnosis relating to hearing loss.  On October 1956 service entrance and October 1958 service separation examinations the Veteran's ears were normal on clinical evaluation and his whispered and spoken voice scores were 15/15 bilaterally.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 1993 letter, R.E.P., M.D. noted that the Veteran had a history of chronic and prolonged hearing loss that dated approximately back to 30 years of age and that he had worn hearing aids for a very prolonged period of time.  The Veteran reported that in 1956 through 1958 he was in the service and worked with a 40 mm gun and did not wear hearing protection.  He reported that his hearing was normal as a child and that he suspected his hearing loss was related to loud noise exposure.  Audiometric testing was interpreted as revealing moderate down sloping symmetric bilateral SNHL.  Speech reception thresholds were 40 decibels bilaterally.  Speech discrimination was 80 percent bilaterally.  She noted that comparison of the current audiogram to one obtained in 1984 showed very little decline in hearing since that time, when discrimination was 84 percent in the right ear and 80 percent in the left ear, with the remainder of the readings remaining unchanged with the exception of 10 to 15 decibel decline at 1 KHz.  The diagnosis was chronic bilateral symmetric down sloping SNHL.   \r\n\r\nIn a June 2008 letter R.C.L., M.A. noted that the Veteran served on active duty from 1955-1958 and was exposed to noise from 40 mm guns while serving on the USS Uvalde.  He noted that the Veteran began to experience tinnitus at that time but was unsure when his hearing diminished and that he had no other significant noise exposure since leaving the Navy.  He added that the Veteran's hearing had become progressively worse and that he began using hearing aids in the mid-1960's, but that he was no longer bothered by tinnitus.  It was noted that puretone audiometry revealed a bilateral moderate to profound downward sloping SNHL with fair word recognition.  R.C.L. summarized that the Veteran had a SNHL consistent with his age and noise exposure history.  He opined that it was \"as likely as not [the Veteran's] hearing loss began during his in-service noise exposure.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 2008 VA examination, puretone thresholds, in decibels, were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\nRIGHT\r\n45\r\n65\r\n80\r\n95\r\n105\r\nLEFT\r\n50\r\n60\r\n65\r\n80\r\n105\r\n\r\nSpeech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 80 percent in the right ear and 88 percent in the left ear.  The diagnosis was moderate to profound gradually sloping bilateral SNHL.  The Veteran reported that he was first tested for hearing loss in the 1970's and began wearing hearing aids at that time.  He reported service in the Navy from 1956 to 1958 as a ship's yeoman.  He reported military noise exposure to gun blasts during one week of gunnery school and exercises aboard ship occurring 3 to 4 days every other month.  He denied occupational noise exposure but reported recreational noise exposure from power tools, a tractor mower, weed wacker, and chainsaw for 7 years without hearing protection.  The examiner (an audiologist) opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was not caused by or a result of noise exposure in the military.  She noted that her opinion was based on review of the claims file, case history, and configuration of the hearing loss.  She noted that the Veteran first tested his hearing and purchased hearing aids in the 1970' (long after service) and that his hearing had become progressively worse since that time.  She noted that the configuration and case history of the Veteran's hearing loss was not consistent with acoustic trauma as such is not progressive after noise exposure is eliminated.  She added that normal whispered voice testing at separation did not rule out a mild hearing loss at that time, but that it certainly ruled out the Veteran's current hearing loss and functional abilities without hearing aids.           \r\n\r\nIn his September 2009 VA Form 9 (substantive appeal) the Veteran noted that he was assigned to man a 40 mm gun during \"General Quarters\" and that he participated in training exercises once or twice per month.  He noted that R.C.L., M.A. had reviewed all documents that he had in his possession.   \r\n\r\nIt is reasonably shown that the Veteran had some exposure to noise trauma in service.  He has consistently alleged (to include 15 years before he filed this claim) that he received frequent noise exposure when he was assigned to a 40 mm gun during general quarters training aboard ship.   The Board finds no reason to question the credibility of the Veteran or the veracity of his accounts, particularly in light of the fact that they are documented many years prior to his claim seeking benefits for hearing loss.  It is also not in dispute that the Veteran has a bilateral hearing loss disability by VA standards, as such is shown by VA audiometry.  \r\n\r\nThe remaining criterion for establishing service connection for the Veteran's hearing loss disability is whether such disability is related to the recognized noise trauma in service.  \r\n\r\nThe opinion of the October 2008 examiner was that the Veteran's hearing loss was not caused by or a result of noise exposure in the military.   The opinion was based on review of the claims file, the examination, case history, configuration of the hearing loss, and the Veteran's normal hearing at separation.  As noted above, the Veteran's \"normal\" hearing at separation does not preclude a grant of service connection if the evidence shows that his hearing loss is related to his service.  It is also noteworthy in this instance that the Board may not prefer one medical opinion over another solely on the basis of claims file review or the absence thereof; most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  The June 2008 opinion of R.C.L., M.A. was that it was as likely as not that the Veteran's hearing loss began during his in-service noise exposure.  The opinion was based on the Veteran's history, an examination, and the configuration of hearing loss.\r\n\r\nThe medical nexus opinions mentioned above were both based on thorough examination of the Veteran, rendered by audiologists, and are competent and probative evidence in the matter.  As noted above claims file review is not dispositive and probative value stems from reasoning.  In this regard, as both opinions are essentially based on the same rationale/reasoning (i.e. the Veteran's hearing loss configuration is or is not consistent with the Veteran's noise exposure) and there are no distinguishing factors that render one opinion more probative than the other, the Board finds the opinions to be in equipoise.    \r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record in this matter is in equipoise.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran (pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102) the Board finds that all the evidentiary and legal requirements for establishing service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing  loss disability are met; service connection for such disability is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL A.

Spector, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from March 1980 to January 1982.\r\n\r\nThis case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2006 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Little Rock, Arkansas.  In August 2008 and August 2009, the Board remanded the case for additional development.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with his rating and subsequently perfected an appeal.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a Video Conference Hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in June 2008.  A written transcript of this hearing was prepared and incorporated into the evidence of record.\r\n\r\nAs a final introductory matter, it does not appear that the following issue has been addressed by the RO.  In a September 2010 statement, the Veteran noted that he disagreed with the noncompensable disability rating he was assigned for residuals of an inguinal hernia, status post repair.  The Board interprets the Veteran's statement as an implicit claim for an initial increased rating for his service-connected residuals of an inguinal hernia, status post repair.  As that claim has not been developed for appellate review, the Board refers it to the RO for appropriate action. \r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2010).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's residuals of a nasal fracture were related to his active service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for a grant of service connection for residuals of a nasal fracture have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010);  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2010).  \r\n\r\nIn light of the favorable disposition, a discussion as to whether VA's duties to notify and assist the Veteran have been satisfied is not required.  The Board finds that no further notification or assistance is necessary, and deciding the appeal at this time is not prejudicial to the Veteran.\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1131.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a). \r\n\r\nHowever, the absence of a documented disability while in service is not fatal to a claim for service connection.  Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  When a Veteran does not meet the regulatory requirements for a disability at separation, he can still establish service connection by submitting evidence that a current disability is causally related to service.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159-60 (1993).  \r\n\r\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992).  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.  \r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the Veteran.\r\n\r\nResiduals of a Nasal Fracture\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that his nasal congestion and rhinitis are related to his active service.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that the initial nasal injury occurred after being struck in the nose by a box in-service.  Additionally, the Veteran contends that he received a nasal fracture after he was hit in-service by other personnel on an aircraft carrier.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's March 1980 entrance examination report did not document a nasal condition on entry.  The Veteran's April 1981 service treatment records showed that the Veteran reported to sick call for a nose injury from being punched.  Additionally, the doctor noted that the Veteran had a small deformity noted on the right side of the nasal cavity.  Furthermore, the doctor noted that the Veteran had slight tenderness upon palpation.  The Veteran was then referred to the Medical Officer (MO).  The MO noted that the Veteran had an obvious deformity of the nose with some deviation to the left.  Additionally, the doctor reported that both of the Veteran's nasal passages were open, with minimal deviation.  Furthermore, the MO noted that the x-ray revealed a positive fracture.  Moreover, the MO informed the Veteran that there was no need for surgery or correction at that time, but that at a later date he may experience nasal blockage and require surgery.   \r\n\r\nThe post-service medical records associated with the file that refer to the Veteran's nasal condition include VA outpatient treatment records, and the May 2010 and June 2010 VA examination reports.\r\n\r\nA June 2003 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran complained of chronic nasal congestion almost daily.  Additionally, he reported to the doctor that he was told in service that he might need nasal surgery.  The doctor diagnosed the Veteran with chronic rhinitis.  In addition, the doctor prescribed Flonase for this condition.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a Video Conference Hearing in June 2008.  The Veteran reported that his rhinitis was caused by an incident in service in April 1981.  Additionally, the Veteran stated that he was aboard an aircraft carrier when some of the guys in his private squadron decided to strike him in the face.  Furthermore, he stated that he complained to his superior about the incident, but it was not written up.  Subsequently, he reported that he went to sick bay and was told that he had a broken nose.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a bone VA examination in May 2010.  The Veteran reported that the onset of his nasal fracture with congestion and rhinitis was in 1981.  Additionally, he reported that the initial nasal injury occurred after being struck in the nose by a box.  Furthermore, he stated that he subsequently received a nasal fracture after he was hit by other personnel on an aircraft carrier.  \r\n\r\nUpon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had an abnormal nasal bone on the midline.  Additionally, the examiner stated that the Veteran had a deformity, which included a septal deviation to the left and an indentation palpated along the nasal bridge.  Furthermore, the examiner noted that the Veteran had evidence of draining sinuses, which included nasal congestion and a deviated septum.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a nasal fracture with congestion and rhinitis.  Additionally, the examiner stated that the Veteran's rhinitis was at least as likely as not related to his nasal fracture incurred while enlisted.  The examiners rationale was that the Veteran had a deviated nasal septum as a result of his nasal fracture, which can precipitate mechanical rhinitis.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was also afforded a nose, sinus, larynx, and pharynx VA examination in June 2010.  The Veteran reported that he had difficulty breathing through his nose.  Additionally, he stated that at night he could not breathe through his nostrils, and that it affected his sleep.  Furthermore, he reported that he had his nose broken twice in service.  The examiner reported that he was unable to find records of the Veteran's broken nose in the chart, but that it might be in there.  Moreover, the Veteran reported that he used cocaine for several years including snorting it.  \r\n\r\nUpon examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran had an inverted V deformity with saddle nose.  Additionally, the Veteran had an anterior airway with a narrow nasal valve, a septum midline, and a moderate turbinate enlargement that responded to decongestion.  Moreover, there was no mucous, pus, or polyps.  Additionally, a scope evaluation was performed without septal deviation or lesions.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's nasal valve collapse was related to weakened and inferior displacement of upper lateral cartilages.  Additionally, the examiner stated that this could be related to trauma or cocaine use.  Furthermore, the examiner reported that if the Veteran sustained nasal trauma during his service, then it was possible that the valve collapse was related.  Lastly, the examiner stated that no bony deformity was seen.  \r\n\r\nThe June 2010 VA examiner submitted a December 2010 addendum report.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's C-file was unavailable at the June examination, and had now been reviewed.  The examiner reported that there was no additional information available in the file giving support for the Veteran's claim of service connection for rhinitis.  Additionally, the examiner stated that the Veteran's records had references to his use of drugs, which included cocaine over a long period.  Furthermore, the examiner noted that there was no evidence of infection, polyps, or  a deviated septum.  Moreover, the examiner stated that chronic obstruction with infection or a deviated septum could give some support to the Veteran's claim, but there was none to report on his examination.  The doctor concluded that it was his impression that the Veteran's current rhinitis was not caused by his nasal fracture, and his current findings of no infections, polyps, or a deviated septum fail to support his claim of rhinitis as being service connection.  Lastly, the examiner noted that the Veteran's symptoms of rhinitis were long standing, and were suggestive of his long history of his nose being a pathway to introduce drugs.  \r\n\r\nAfter a careful review of the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's service treatment records, VA outpatient treatment records, pertinent lay evidence, and, in particular, the positive nexus opinion provided by the May 2010 VA examiner, demonstrate that his currently diagnosed nasal condition is related to his period of military service.\r\n\r\nIn comparing positive and negative evidence, the Board may favor the opinion of one competent medical professional over that of another, as long as an adequate statement of reasons and bases is provided.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).  With regard to medical opinions, the credibility and weight to be attached to a medical opinion are within the Board's province as finder of fact.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).   Greater weight may be placed on one opinion over another depending on factors such as reasoning employed and whether the examiner was informed of the relevant facts.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, No. 06-312 (U.S. Vet. App. Dec. 1, 2008).  Among the factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).\r\n\r\nConsidering the relative merits of the analytical findings and the details of the opinions, the Board places more weight on the opinion from the May 2010 VA examiner as it was supported by a rationale, detailed and consistent with other evidence of record.  The Board rejects the negative opinion by the June 2010 VA examiner.  In the June 2010 VA examination  report, the examiner noted that he was unable to find records of the Veteran's in-service broken nose in the chart.  Additionally, he stated that if the Veteran sustained nasal trauma during his service, then it was possible that the valve collapse was related.  Furthermore, in the December 2010 addendum report, the examiner noted that the Veteran's C-file was unavailable at the June examination, and that it had now been reviewed.  Moreover, the examiner reported that there was no additional information available giving support for the Veteran's service connection claim for rhinitis.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's current rhinitis was not caused by his nasal fracture.  However, while ostensibly predicated on a review of the claims folder, the VA examiner's opinion did not address other pertinent evidence, including the April 1981 service treatment record that showed that the Veteran was treated for a nose injury after being punched, and was diagnosed with a nasal fracture.  Additionally, the doctor at that time informed the Veteran that that at a later date he may experience nasal blockage and require surgery.   Accordingly, because the examiner's opinion was based on an incomplete and inaccurate factual history of the Veteran's in-service incident that resulted in a nasal fracture, the Board finds that the June 2010 examination report and December 2010 addendum are not adequate for rating purposes.  Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet.App. 171, 179 (2005) (citing Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) and Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 229 (1993)) (stating that the Board is not bound to accept medical opinions that are based upon an inaccurate factual background); see also 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.2 (stating that if the findings on an examination report do not contain sufficient detail, it is incumbent upon the rating board to return the report as inadequate for evaluation purposes).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the May 2010 VA examiner noted and considered the Veteran's in-service incidents and the April 1981 service treatment record that reported the onset of the Veteran's nasal fracture.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a nasal fracture with congestion and rhinitis.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's rhinitis was at least as likely as not related to his nasal fracture incurred while enlisted.  The examiners rationale was that the Veteran had a deviated nasal septum as a results of his nasal fracture which can precipitate mechanical rhinitis.  Given the VA examiner's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of his opinion, the Board finds this opinion to be highly probative to determining whether service connection for a nasal condition is warranted.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that the balance of positive and negative evidence is at the very least in relative equipoise with respect to the Veteran's residuals of a nasal fracture claim.  He is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.  Indeed, where the evidence supports a claim or is in relative equipoise, the appellant prevails.  38 U.S.C.A. 5107 (b); Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.  Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for residuals of a nasal fracture is warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for residuals of a nasal fracture is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJ.

Richardson, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the military from July 1968 to July 1972.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is from a May 2009 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Muskogee, Oklahoma - which increased the rating for the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability (a muscle strain) from 0 to 10 percent retroactively effective from February 6, 2009, the date of receipt of this claim.  However, the RO denied his remaining claims for service connection for a sleep condition and a left shoulder condition.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's June 2008 notice of disagreement (NOD), in response, only concerned the denial of his claim for a sleep disorder.  So this is the only claim the RO addressed in the November 2009 statement of the case (SOC).  When submitting his substantive appeal (VA Form 9) later in November 2009 to complete the steps necessary to perfect his appeal of this claim to the Board, the Veteran also submitted additional evidence in support of this claim and did not waive his right to have the RO initially consider it, such as in a supplemental SOC (SSOC).  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 19.31, 19.37 (2010).  Ordinarily, this would require remanding the claim to have the RO or Appeals Management Center (AMC), as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), consider this additional evidence in the first instance.  Since, however, the Board is granting the claim, in full, it may immediately consider this additional evidence and proceed with deciding this claim as there is no resulting prejudice to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 20.800, 20.1304(c).  See also Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  Because especially of the chronic pain associated with his service-connected right shoulder disability, the Veteran has had difficulty sleeping to the point of insomnia since sustaining the injury to this shoulder during his military service.\r\n\r\n2.  He also has sleep apnea, confirmed by a sleep study, and uses a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine to treat this sleep disorder, but he is not alleging this disorder is attributable to his military service, rather, readily acknowledges that it is instead the result of other unrelated factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's sleep impairment, to the extent he has insomnia, is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by the persistent pain associated with his \r\nservice-connected right shoulder disability, so a secondary disability.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.310 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  The Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA) enhanced VA's duties to notify and assist Veterans with claims for VA benefits.  The VCAA was codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126, and the implementing regulations were codified at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).\r\n\r\nHere, though, since the Board is granting the Veteran's claim for service connection for a sleep disorder - in full, there is no need to discuss whether there has been compliance with these notice-and-duty-to-assist provisions of the VCAA.  \r\n\r\nThis is because even were the Board to assume, for the sake of argument, there has not been, this is ultimately inconsequential and, therefore, at most nonprejudicial, i.e., harmless error.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1102; Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).  His claim is being granted, regardless.\r\n\r\nII.  Entitlement to Service Connection for a Sleep Disorder\r\n\r\nService connection is granted if the evidence shows a current disability resulted from an injury or a disease that was incurred or aggravated during active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nDirect service connection generally requires evidence of a current disability with a relationship or connection to an injury or a disease or some other manifestation of the disability during service.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000).\r\n\r\nService connection also may be granted on a secondary basis for disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or chronically aggravated by a service-connected condition.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310(a) & (b).  See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).\r\n\r\nSupporting medical evidence is generally, though not always, required to associate the claimed condition with a service-connected disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998); McQueen v. West, 13 Vet. App. 237 (1999); Velez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 148, 158 (1998).\r\n\r\nMedical evidence is not always required because, in certain instances, depending on the circumstances of the particular case - such as the type of condition specifically claimed, this necessary medical diagnosis and etiology instead may be established by lay evidence.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\r\n\r\nThe determination as to whether these requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  See Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the facts of this particular case.  As explained, the first and indeed perhaps most fundamental requirement for any service-connection claim is there must be competent evidence of the existence of the currently claimed disability.  Boyer, 210 F.3d at 1353; Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (service connection presupposes a current diagnosis of the condition claimed, to at least confirm the Veteran has it; without this minimum level of proof, there can be no valid claim).  The Veteran's private treatment records include records from a private physician, A.F., M.D., indicating that insomnia is among the Veteran's active and ongoing problems.  Insomnia is the inability to sleep, abnormal wakefulness.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 957 (31st ed. 2007).  So even absent this physician's diagnosis, the Veteran, even as a layman, is competent to proclaim that he experiences insomnia, especially since this condition, by its very nature, is capable of his lay observation.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when:  (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nSo resolution of this claim ultimately turns instead on whether the Veteran's insomnia is attributable to his military service - either directly or secondarily by way of a service-connected disability.  See Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993) (\"A determination of service connection requires a finding of the existence of a current disability and a determination of a relationship between that disability and an injury or a disease incurred in service.\").  See, too, Maggitt v. West, 202 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2000); D'Amico v. West, 209 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Hibbard v. West, 13 Vet. App. 546, 548 (2000); and Collaro v. West, 136 F.3d 1304, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\nThe essential basis of the Veteran claim is that he has experienced chronic, so persistent, right shoulder pain since injuring (straining) this shoulder during his military service, indeed so much so that he often has been unable to sleep at night and, thus, has what may be considered a consequent sleep disorder.  He claims that, over time, his right shoulder pain has gotten so bad that he now requires prescription sleep aids.  See his February 2009 statement.  He further claims that, since service, he initially just learned to live with this ongoing problem, treating it with over-the-counter medication until 2006.  But he says that year it got so bad that he saw a doctor about it and eventually received a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  He resultantly started using a CPAP machine in 2007.  And although the CPAP machine has rather successfully addressed and alleviated his sleep apnea, he has continued to experience a severe disruption in his sleep because of the extent of his lingering right shoulder pain from the injury in service, for which service connection since has been granted.  [Note:  the RO's May 2009 decision at issue, as already alluded to, increased the rating for this right shoulder disability from 0 to 10 percent - retroactively effective as of the date of receipt of his claim on February 9, 2009, so itself an acknowledgment that this disability has gotten worse.]  One other important point worth mentioning is that he is not requesting service connection for his sleep apnea; rather, he is claiming entitlement to service connection for his sleep impairment (i.e., insomnia), to the extent it is attributable to his service-connected right shoulder disability.  See his June 2009 NOD and November 2009 VA Form 9.\r\n\r\nThe records concerning the Veteran's service, and the additional evaluation and treatment records since service, provide the necessary support for his claim.  The report of his May 1972 military separation examination indicates he mentioned that his right shoulder hurt when he slept on it, so this was a documented problem even then.  His service treatment records (STRs) also show that, in June 1972, he received treatment in relation to his complaints of right shoulder pain, and the examiner noted the Veteran reported having pain at night when in bed.  These records are competent and credible evidence indicating his right shoulder disability caused him sleeping problems even when in service, and he has continued to experience these same problems during the many years since.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's post-service treatment records shows that, in April 1996, he complained of sleeping difficulties, acknowledging, however, that he was not then currently taking any medication for this.  However, a June 2002 record indicates he had begun taking Lortab at night for pain in his right shoulder, and that this pain was keeping him awake at night.  A November 2007 sleep study report from a private doctor, E.S., D.O., provides a diagnosis of moderate obstructive sleep apnea with significant associated oxygen desaturation and arousal.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran also has submitted treatment records from his private physician, Dr. A.F., in further support of his claim.  A March 2009 treatment record indicates the Veteran sought treatment for symptoms including abdominal pain and fever; but this doctor also indicated that, while the Veteran was using his CPAP (for his sleep apnea), he was still having a sleeping problem because when he rolled onto his sides, his shoulders hurt and this caused him to wake up.  A June 2009 treatment record indicates the Veteran complained of shoulder pain that was exacerbated by lying on his side, again also noting that it woke him up.  He reported having had this pain for 38 years - so since approximately 1971, which was during his military service (keeping in mind that he served from 1968 to 1972).\r\n\r\nIn March 2009, VA provided the Veteran a Compensation and Pension Examination (C&P Exam), performed by an outside contractor, a family practice physician.  This examiner evaluated the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability, but did not also address his claimed sleep disorder - including especially in terms of whether it is attributable to any extent to the chronic pain associated with this service-connected disability.  Still, this report indicates the Veteran's right shoulder disability had worsened.  And, as mentioned, because of this, the RO subsequently increased the rating for this right shoulder disability from 0 to 10 percent in the May 2009 decision from which this appeal ensued.  So while that VA examination report does not specifically address the etiology of the Veteran's sleep disorder, it does nonetheless support his assertions that his right shoulder disability, in particular his associated pain, has progressively increased over time so as to, in turn, become more and more problematic.\r\n\r\nAs other evidence supporting the claim, in November 2009 Dr. A.F. submitted a statement indicating the Veteran has osteoartrosis of the right shoulder that causes him not to be able to sleep.  For this, added Dr. A.F., he has prescribed Ambien, Lexapro, and Neurontin.\r\n\r\nAll of the medical and other evidence mentioned, especially when considered collectively, supports the notion that the Veteran has experienced difficulty sleeping since injuring his right shoulder in service, often to the point of insomnia because of the extent of the residual pain in this shoulder from that injury.  Thus, since it has been established that his insomnia is proximately due to, the result of, or at the very least aggravated by the chronic pain from this service-connected disability, his insomnia must be service connected on this secondary basis, particularly if all reasonable doubt concerning this is resolved in his favor.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996) (indicating an \"absolutely accurate\" determination of etiology is not a condition precedent to granting service connection, nor is \"definite\" or \"obvious\" etiology).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nThe claim for service connection for a sleep disorder (insomnia, but not sleep apnea) is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nKEITH W.

G. Mazzucchelli, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1950 to June 1954.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The case is currently under the jurisdiction of the New York, New York RO.  The Veteran provided testimony before the undersigned at a hearing in New York, New York in April 2011; a transcript of that hearing is of record.  In July 2011, the Board remanded the case for additional development.  The Board is satisfied that there has been substantial compliance with the remand directives and the Board may proceed with review. Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nAs noted on the Board's remand, the rating decision on appeal characterized the issue as whether new and material evidence had been received to reopen a previously denied claim of service connection for pes planus.  However, review of the record shows that the Veteran was not provided with written notice of the April 1961 denial of his claim for service connection for pes planus, and thus that denial did not become final.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7105.  Accordingly, the Board has recharacterized the issue to reflect that the issue is being addressed on a de novo basis.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2010).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nBilateral pes planus had its onset during active service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nBilateral pes planus was incurred as a result of the Veteran's active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nNotice and Assistance\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the duties to notify and assist have been met to the extent necessary to grant the claim for service connection.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159.  Thus, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in deciding his claim at this time.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 392-94 (1993).  \r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  In order to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nGoverning law provides that a veteran will be presumed to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled in service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service.  Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted.  When no preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, the veteran is presumed to have been sound upon entry and then the burden falls on the government to rebut the presumption of soundness.  Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Rebutting the presumption of soundness requires that VA show by clear and unmistakable evidence that (1) the veteran's disability existed prior to service and (2) that the preexisting disability was not aggravated during service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1111; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has bilateral pes planus that began during his period of active duty.  He has testified that his Navy service involved lifting and carrying heavy ordnance and equipment, and that he believes this resulted in his pes planus.  \r\n\r\nThe service treatment records show that no foot disability was noted at enlistment.  There is no record of treatment for pes planus during service, however the discharge examination in August 1954 noted first degree pes planus, not considered disabling.  Recent VA outpatient records show notations of pes planus and X-ray evidence of loss of normal plantar arch bilaterally.  \r\n\r\nOn VA examination in July 2011, the examiner diagnosed mild pes planus as well as calcaneal spurs and mild degenerative changes.  The examiner stated that pes planus was a congenital condition that \"might have been missed\" on the Veteran's service entrance examination.\r\n\r\nWhile the VA examiner indicated that pes planus is a congenital condition that might have been missed on the Veteran's entrance into service, the fact remains that no such disability was identified on the entrance examination and the examiner's statement is equivocal on the question of whether the disability actually existed prior to service.  In short, the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence of preexisting pes planus.  Hence, the Veteran was in sound physical condition at entrance into service.\r\n\r\nEven assuming there was pes planus that preexisted service, there is no clear and unmistakable evidence to establish that pre-existing pes planus was not aggravated during service, as it was noted at separation and the Veteran has testified to lifting and carrying heavy ordnance and equipment during service that he believes contributed to his pes planus.  The presumption of sound condition upon entry into service is not rebutted and the Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition upon entry into service.\r\n\r\nIf the government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1111, the Veteran's claim is one for service connection.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1089. The question on appeal is whether the Veteran currently suffers bilateral pes planus that was incurred in service.  Here, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran currently has bilateral pes planus, that that condition was first noted at his separation from active duty service, and that he has reported that he has experienced foot symptoms for many years following his separation from service.  Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the appellant, the Board finds that the evidence supports service connection for bilateral pes planus.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for bilateral pes planus is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nM.

Flynn, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1958 to November 1960.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Roanoke, Virginia, which denied the Veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nThis matter was previously before the Board in April 2012, at which time it solicited an expert medical opinion from a physician with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The Board received the requested opinion in June 2012.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2011).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe competent and credible evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether a relationship exists between the Veteran's current right arm condition and his military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving the benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, a right arm condition was incurred in active duty military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim has been granted, as discussed below.  As such, the Board finds that any error related to the VCAA is moot.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2011); Mlechick v. Mansfield, 503 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nA veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2011).  When a veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran prevails.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  The preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim for benefits to be denied.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran essentially contends that he has a right arm condition that is related to his military service.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2010).  In order to establish service connection for the Veteran's claimed disabilities, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the first Hickson element, evidence of a current disability, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has an ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome).  The first Hickson element, evidence of a current disability, is therefore met.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second Hickson element, in-service disease or injury, the Veteran's September 1960 service separation examination stated that the Veteran had moderate muscular weakness of the right arm.  The second Hickson element, in-service injury or disease, is therefore met.\r\n\r\nRegarding the third Hickson element, a nexus between the Veteran's disability and his military service, an April 2008 VA examiner indicated that it would be \"mere speculation\" to opine whether the Veteran's military service was the cause of the Veteran's right arm condition.  Accordingly, the Board solicited an expert opinion from a VHA neurologist.  The Board received such an opinion in June 2012, and the opinion extensively discussed the Veteran's pertinent medical history.  The VHA neurologist concluded that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's ulnar neuropathy was related to his active duty military service.  The third Hickson element, a nexus between the Veteran's disability and his military service, is therefore satisfied.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with all three Hickson elements satisfied, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a right arm disability is granted, subject to the controlling laws and regulations that govern awards of VA compensation.  See 38 U.S.C.A.      \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R.   \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.400 (2011); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a right arm condition is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMARK W.

I. Velez, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from September 1972 to August 1973, from February 1974 to May 1977, from September 18, 2001 to September 23, 2001, from August 25, 2006 to February 2007, and from November 2009 to August 2010.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 1993 rating action by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) located in Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nA hearing in front of the undersigned Acting Veteran's Law judge was held in May 2003.  The Veterna was not present but his representative made an oral argument on his behalf.  A transcript of the same has been associated with the claim file.  \r\n\r\nThe claim was previously remanded in February 1997, January 2004 and March 2008. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nConsidering the probative, i.e., competent and credible, medical and other evidence of record, it is just as likely as not the Veteran was sexually assaulted during his military service and that his posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), since diagnosed, is attributable to that sexual trauma. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD are reasonably met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1154, 5103, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2011). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA applies to the instant claim. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board is rendering a decision in favor of the Veteran, granting service connection for PTSD.  Therefore, a further discussion of the VCAA duties is unnecessary. \r\n\r\nII. Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, specifically PTSD related to a sexual assault he endured while he was in service.  In statements from the Veteran, he stated that on his eighteenth birthday, he was sodomized and raped.  According to the Veteran, he was at a bar off base celebrating his birthday when he was approached by a stranger who suggested that the Veteran go to his apartment and sleep on the couch because he was very drunk.  Once at the apartment, the Veteran was attacked by the stranger who hit him over the head several times and threatened to kill him unless he did as was told.  He was then sodomized and raped.  The Veteran stated he did not report the incident to anyone in fear that he would be accused of having done this willingly and being kicked out of the military for homosexual behavior.  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a) (i.e., under the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM- IV)); a link, established by medical evidence, between the veteran's current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  If a PTSD claim is based on a claimed in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102. \r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's post-service medical records clearly indicates that he has been diagnosed with PTSD, and the claims file contains medical evidence linking the Veteran's PTSD to the alleged in-service assaults.  Indeed, an October 1999 VA examination notes a diagnosis of PTSD and the noted triggering stressor is the rape described above.  An October 2010 psychiatric evaluation from the Vet Center notes a diagnosis of PTSD with the triggering stressor also being the reported sexual assault.  Although the evidence does include a diagnosis of PTSD tied to the Veteran's history of sexual trauma while in service, service connection can only be granted on showing credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  Thus, the remaining issue is whether the reported stressor has been corroborated. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any complaints or findings of a psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and/or depression.  Service treatment records of November 1976, from the second period of active service, do show a diagnosis of inadequate personality with explosive and schizoid features.  It was recommended that he be administratively separated at the earliest convenience of the command.  \r\n\r\nPost-service, the Veteran was diagnosed with chronic anxiety neurosis with severe explosive and schizoid features in June 1979.  In January 1992, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a nervous condition, PTSD.  In a letter of June 1993, the Veteran was requested to submit a statement describing the claimed stressors of his PTSD.  In a June 1993 letter, the Veteran recounted the above- mentioned sexual assault.  A VA examination report of August 1992 shows a diagnosis of PTSD based on the sexual assault.  The record also contains a lay statement of June 1993 from D.M.M., a fellow servicemember, stating that the Veteran told him about the sexual assault just three days after it occurred and that he noticed the Veteran change for the worse from then on.  A VA examination report of July 1993 notes a diagnosis of PTSD based on the claimed sexual assault.  \r\n\r\nSignificantly, the Veteran has been consistent in his account of the alleged sexual trauma stressor.  Since 1993, when he was first asked to describe the claimed stressor, he has submitted numerous statements recounted the claimed sexual trauma in the same manner and with the same details.  This is almost 20 years of recounting an event in the same way.  Moreover, the Veteran has submitted a lay statement from a fellow servicemember who knew him at the time, who stated the Veteran told him of the incident just days after it happened, and describing how the Veteran changed after that.  The Board finds the Veteran's consistency and the lay statement to be evidence in the Veteran's favor.\r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed the Veteran service personnel records to see if there is any indication within those records that the Veteran's performance changed after the claimed sexual assault.  In this regard, the Board notes that the personnel records show that in July 1973, after the claimed sexual assault, the Veteran was evaluated with scores of 2.0 in professional performance and military appearance, and 2.6 in military behavior and adaptability.  By August 1973, he was evaluated with scores of 2.0 for professional performance, 2.4 for military behavior and adaptability, and 1.0 in military appearance.  He was not recommended for reenlistment and was consequently discharged with a general discharge.  While the change in the Veteran's evaluations was not dramatic, the Board notes that there was a change for the worse in all but one of the evaluated traits.  This is evidence in the Veteran's favor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board finds significant that the Veteran was noted to be psychiatrically normal upon entrance to service in 1972.  However, there appears to have been a deterioration of the Veteran throughout his service.  Notably, during his second period of service from 1974 to 1977, he was diagnosed with inadequate personality with explosive and schizoid features.  \r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the Board notes that the Veteran's psychiatric diagnosis is PTSD.  Accordingly, based on the current PTSD diagnosis, the opinions relating the diagnosis of PTSD to the sexual trauma, and the evidence suggesting in-service sexual trauma, which includes the valid psychiatric testing and the lay statements, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the Veteran's claim is at least in equipoise.

Ganz, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from July 2005 to September 2006. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Detroit, Michigan, which, in pertinent part, denied entitlement to service connection for a TBI.   \r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's Virtual VA claim file shows that there have been VA treatment records added to his file since the last supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) readjudicating his claim was issued.  The Veteran has also been granted a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).  Neither the Veteran nor his representative have waived the Veteran's right to have these records considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in the first instance.  \r\n\r\nA review of these records shows that they support his current claim and, given the favorable outcome noted below, no conceivable prejudice to the Veteran could result from the Board proceeding with its decision without a waiver of AOJ initial consideration.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993). \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nResolving all doubt, the competent evidence shows a relationship between the current residuals of a TBI and service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for residuals of a TBI have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159, 3.303 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nNotice and Assistance\r\n\r\nThe claim of service connection for residuals of a TBI has been considered with respect to VA's duties to notify and assist.  Given the favorable outcome noted above, no conceivable prejudice to the Veteran could result from this decision.  See Bernard, 4 Vet. App. at 394. \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for residuals of a TBI.  He claims that his TBI is related to an explosion from an improvised explosive device (IED) and a motor vehicle accident (MVA) during service.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Veteran is service connected for a facial scar that is located on the brow of nose between his eyes, with a non-compensable rating, which a review of the claim file shows resulted from a MVA.  His personnel records show that he was awarded the Combat Action Badge.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Service connection may be granted for a disability diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability is due to disease or injury which was incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d). \r\n\r\nGenerally, to prevail on a claim of service connection on the merits, there must be competent evidence of (1) current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence or other competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). \r\nWhen all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show he was involved in an IED blast and a MVA during service.  A November 2005 statement of medical examination and duty status noted that the Veteran was on active duty when he was involved in a MVA in Kirkuk, Iraq.  He was an unrestrained gunner in a vehicle that hit a concrete barrier.  He had a lacerated forehead and injured neck.  A November 2005 STR noted that the Veteran was in a MVA and lacerated his forehead.  He did not have dizziness or visual disturbances.  A January 29, 2006 STR noted that the Veteran was hit with an IED the day before and was given an assessment of low back strain secondary to IED blast.  \r\n\r\nThe determinative issue is therefore whether the Veteran has any current residuals of a TBI from his head injury from a MVA or an IED blast.  \r\n\r\nA VA examination was conducted in December 2007.  The examiner noted a review of the Veteran's claim file.  While he was in Iraq in November 2005 he was on a night operation when the driver lost control of the vehicle and hit a concrete barrier.  The Veteran hit his head on the radio and was wearing a helmet.  He did not loose consciousness and is not currently being treated.  The examiner noted that the initial injury was moderate, and the Veteran reported short term memory impairment and difficulty concentrating since the injury.  He also reported headaches at the base of the skull.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a TBI as established by VA.  \r\n\r\nIt is noted that there is no VA statutory or regulatory diagnostic criteria required to establish service connection for a TBI (as opposed to PTSD or hearing loss for example) as was noted in the above VA examination report, but rather there are regulations governing how TBIs are evaluated once service connection is in effect.  \r\nA VA PTSD examination was conducted in March 2008.  The examiner noted a review of the Veteran's claim file.  The examiner reported that the Veteran was mobilized to Iraq and sustained injuries, including a TBI during combat related activities.  The examiner noted that during his MVA, the Veteran hit his head on the radio and that as a HUMVEE driver and gunner he was involved in a lot of combat, including when his armored vehicle was directly hit by an IED.  A psychological examination, which found that the Veteran had mildly impaired recent memory, was conducted.  The examiner noted that while on patrol the Veteran was on the gun turret and a tremendous explosion occurred.  The Veteran was given a diagnosis of cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) attributable to a TBI sustained while in Iraq.  The examiner noted further that when developing new learning, especially verbal material, the Veteran can be expected to require more practice than before his deployment and involvement in combat actives and his TBI.  \r\n\r\nThus, while the December 2007 VA examiner found that the Veteran did not have a TBI or any residuals thereof, the March 2008 VA examiner found that he did and that the residual of it was a cognitive disorder NOS.  Both VA examination reports are based on a review of the claim file and on an accurate factual basis regarding the Veteran's in-service injuries.  Thus, both examinations are competent medical evidence and probative of the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed residuals of a TBI.  There is no reason to assign more probative weight to either VA examination report.  The competent evidence of record is clearly in equipoise and any doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor; accordingly, service connection for residuals of a TBI is warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for residuals of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is granted.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nRONALD W.

Duties to Notify and Assist \r\n\r\nVA has duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  Because service connection for tinnitus is granted, VA's duties to notify and assist are deemed fully satisfied and the Veteran is not prejudiced by a decision on his claim at this time. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156, 3.159.\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection \r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that tinnitus began during service.  During his April 2011 VA audiology examination, the Veteran reported that he first noticed ringing in his ears around 1966, which worsened over time and is now constant in both ears.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110.  Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nA claimant may rely on lay evidence \"to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition; (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.\" Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. The Veteran is competent to report what he experiences; i.e., he is competent to report that he first experienced ringing in his ears during service, that the ringing has continued since that time, and that he currently experiences ringing in his ears. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served as a supply officer during service, but worked on the flight line from 1964 to 1966.  The Veteran reported that during this time, he worked around jet engines without hearing protection, and that his tinnitus began in 1966.  Post-service, the Veteran reported minimal noise exposure. \r\n\r\nAlthough the record is silent on complaints of or treatment for tinnitus during service, the Veteran is competent to describe the nature and extent of his in-service noise exposure. There is no evidence that the Veteran is not credible. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran had noise exposure during service. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(2); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005).\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, the Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination.  In a May 2011 opinion, the same examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is not as least as likely as not related to his military service because the there were no complaints of tinnitus in the Veteran's record. \r\n\r\nAfter review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for tinnitus based on the competent and credible evidence that the Veteran's tinnitus began during service and has existed since. The Board acknowledges that the record includes a negative nexus opinion from a VA examiner.  However, the Board notes that the examiner did not consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of and continuity of the Veteran's tinnitus. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  Thus, the VA examiner's opinion regarding the Veteran's tinnitus is of limited probative value. \r\n\r\nThe Board finds the evidence is in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service. The evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran has tinnitus; that he was exposed to acoustic trauma in service; that he had minimal noise exposure post-service; and that he has experienced tinnitus since service.  In such circumstances, the benefit of the doubt goes to the Veteran; service connection is granted. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nM.

Turner, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1953 to June 1955\r\n\r\nThis matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from a January 2012 rating decision issued by the Regional Office (RO).  It was remanded for additional development by the Board in October 2013, and has now been returned for appellate disposition.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in June 2013.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the VBMS and Virtual VA paperless claims processing systems.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2012).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nIt is at least as likely as not that a sensorineural hearing loss disability was caused by a disease or injury in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nHearing loss was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5013, 5103A,  5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303 (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board considered the regulations pertaining to the VA's statutory duty to assist the Veteran with the development of facts pertinent to his claim.  Given the favorable action taken herein below, the Board finds that no further assistance in developing the facts pertinent to the Veteran's claims is required at this time.  \r\n\r\nService connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he developed bilateral hearing loss as a result of exposure to loud noise during his military service.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury that was incurred in, or aggravated by, service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  Service connection for some chronic diseases, including sensorineural hearing loss, may be granted if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge if all of the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nTo establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: \"(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service\"-the so-called \"nexus\" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The requirement that a current disability exist is satisfied if the claimant had a disability at the time his claim for VA disability compensation was filed or during the pendency of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). However, in the case of the chronic diseases set forth in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309, the requisite nexus may also be provided by evidence of continuity of symptoms.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013).    \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of applying the laws administered by the V.A., hearing impairment is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of these thresholds are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, a July 2011 VA audiogram establishes that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability.  The examiner noted the type of hearing loss was sensorineural.\r\n\r\nThrough written statements and testimony presented at his June 2013 hearing, the Veteran demonstrated that he was exposed to loud noise from rifles, generators, and atomic blasts in service, so noise exposure is conceded.  The Veteran testified that this was without hearing protection.  The Veteran also testified that noise exposure after service was with hearing protection, and not as loud as the generator noise that he was exposed to in service.  In correspondence and at his hearing he indicated that he had a long history of hearing difficulties since service.  He testified that he had trouble hearing his wife even early in their marriage more than 50 years ago.  The Board finds that the Veteran's testimony about his hearing loss is credible.\r\n\r\nWhile in a June 2011 VA examination report and a November 2013 addendum a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss was less likely than not related  to service, she based her conclusion in part on the assumption that the Veteran's hearing loss occurred only 20 years ago.  The Veteran has adamantly asserted that this is incorrect; he began receiving treatment 20 years ago but had difficulty hearing long before that.  Since the Board finds that the examiner's conclusions were based on an incorrect factual premise, they are of limited probative value.  The Board finds the lay evidence presented by the Veteran about the continuity of his symptoms since service to be more probative.  Thus, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that a hearing loss disability was incurred in service.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nH.

T. Hutcheson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is the appellant in the instant appeal.  He had active service from August 1972 to September 1975.  \r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2005 rating decision of the Houston, Texas, Regional Office (RO) which, in pertinent part, denied service connection for a right knee disorder.  In November 2011, the Board remanded the Veteran's appeal to the RO for additional action.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2013, the Board remanded the Veteran's appeal to the RO for additional action. The Board has reviewed the both the Veterans Benefit Management System (VBMS) and the \"Virtual VA\" files.  This appeal was processed using the VBMS paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of the Veteran's appeal should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reframed the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for a right knee disorder to include traumatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, and meniscectomy residuals, in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims' (Court) decision in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (finding that a claim for benefits for one psychiatric disability also encompassed benefits based on other psychiatric diagnoses and should be considered by the Board to be within the scope of the filed claim).  \r\n\r\nIn a May 2012 written statement, the Veteran advanced that service connection was warranted for a right hip disorder to include arthritis, a left hip disorder to include arthritis, a right elbow disorder to include arthritis, a left elbow disorder to include arthritis, a right wrist disorder to include arthritis, a left wrist disorder to include arthritis, a right hand disorder to include arthritis, and a left hand disorder to include arthritis secondary to his service-connected left knee disorder.  The issues have not been adjudicated by the RO.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over them.  The issues are referred to the RO for appropriate action.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  Service connection is currently in effect for left knee lateral tibial plateau fracture residuals with degenerative joint disease and left ankle chip fracture residuals.  \r\n\r\n2.  Right knee traumatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, and meniscectomy residuals have been related to the Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity disabilities.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nRight knee traumatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, and meniscectomy residuals were incurred proximately due to or as the result of the Veteran's left knee lateral tibial plateau fracture residuals with degenerative joint disease and left ankle chip fracture residuals.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2013); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.310(a), 3.326(a) (2013).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duty to Notify and to Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The Court issued a decision in the appeal of Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473(2006), which held that the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection claim, including the degree of disability and the effective date of an award.  Those five elements include: (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between a veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  \r\n\r\nIn this decision, the Board grants service connection for right knee traumatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, and meniscectomy residuals.  Therefore, no further discussion of VA's duties to notify and to assist is necessary.  \r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection for a Right Knee Disorder\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that service connection for a right knee disorder is warranted secondary to his service-connected left lower extremity disorders.  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310(a).  The Court has clarified that service connection shall be granted on a secondary basis under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310(a) where it is demonstrated that a service-connected disorder has aggravated a nonservice-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  Service connection is currently in effect for left knee lateral tibial plateau fracture residuals with degenerative joint disease and left ankle chip fracture residuals.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records do not refer to a right knee disorder.  \r\n\r\nClinical documentation from J. Bocell, Jr., M.D. dated between December 1987 and February 1988 conveys that the Veteran reported that he had been standing on scaffolding working inside a tank when he twisted to the left and his right knee popped loudly.  He subsequently underwent right knee arthroscopic surgery and was diagnosed with traumatic chondromalacia, a chondral fracture of the medial femoral condyle, and multiple cartilaginous loose bodies.  \r\n\r\nA January 2002 VA orthopedic evaluation states that the Veteran reported that he had \"slowly developed some problems in both knees subsequent\" to his in-service left knee disorder.  The Veteran was diagnosed with traumatic arthritis of the knees.  \r\n\r\nA November 2002 VA treatment record states that the Veteran presented a \"history of previous knee injury and meniscectomy bilaterally.\"  A March 2005 VA X-ray study of the right knee revealed findings consistent with degenerative joint disease.   \r\n\r\nAt a March 2005 examination for compensation purposes conducted for the VA, the examiner opined that:  \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the patient has crepitus in the right knee with pain, fatigue and lack of endurance on [range of motion].  An X-ray of the right knee should be done to determine a diagnosis since the right knee condition is more likely than not secondary to the left knee condition.  This is due to the extensive degenerative disease in the left knee that causes him to alter his gait and weight distribution to favor the left knee.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded VA examinations in January 2007, February 2012, and September 2012 which diagnosed him with right knee degenerative joint disease and internal derangement.  While the VA examiners at those evaluations determined that the Veteran's December 1987 right knee symptoms while at work were not caused by or related his service-connected left knee disorder, the physicians made no specific findings as whether the Veteran's post-service right knee disabilities had increased in severity beyond their natural progression as the result of his significantly disabling left lower extremity disorders.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons and upon resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for right knee traumatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, and meniscectomy residuals secondary to the Veteran's service-connected left knee lateral tibial plateau fracture residuals with degenerative joint disease and left ankle chip fracture residuals is now warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.310.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection of right knee traumatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease, and meniscectomy residuals is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK.

Hughes, Counsel\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from January 1958 to May 1961.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2012 rating decision of the Louisville, Kentucky Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The claims file is currently under the jurisdiction of the St. Petersburg, Florida RO.  In March 2014, a videoconference hearing was held before the undersigned; a transcript of the hearing is associated with the record.  After the hearing, VA received additional evidence (private treatment report and opinion) with a waiver of RO initial consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had been represented by The American Legion; however, he revoked his designation of them as his representative, and appointed Disabled American Veterans (DAV) to replace them.  See July 2012 VA Forms 21-22, Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran served on active duty at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from November 1959 to May 1961.\r\n\r\n2.  It is reasonably shown that the Veteran's CLL is related to his exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for CLL is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303 (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA applies to this claim.  However, as service connection for CLL is being granted, there is no reason to belabor the impact of the VCAA on the matter (or to engage in any detailed discussion of the adequacy of the notice that was provided at the hearing before the undersigned.\r\n\r\nLegal Criteria, Factual Background, and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability that is due to disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  \r\n\r\nTo substantiate a claim of service connection, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The determination as to whether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of all evidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a). \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service personnel records show that he served at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina from November 1959 to May 1961.  \r\n\r\nCLL was not manifested during service or within one year following the Veteran's discharge from active duty.\r\n\r\nPrivate treatment records show that in November 2006 the Veteran was found to have an elevated white blood cell count; early stage CLL was suspected.  Later records show a diagnosis of, and treatment for, low-grade lymphoma/leukemia.  \r\n\r\nA VA Compensation and Pension Service VA Fast Letter (11-03 -revised January 28, 2013) acknowledges that persons residing or working at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Lejeune from the 1950s to the mid-1980s were potentially exposed to drinking water contaminated with volatile organic compounds, including benzene, vinyl chloride, tetrachloroethylene, perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE).  A VA Training Letter (11-03 -revised November 2011) notes that in 2009 the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council (NRC) published \"Contaminated Water Supplies at Camp Lejeune, Assessing Potential Health Effects\".  This report includes a review of studies addressing exposure to TCE, and Tetrachloroethylene or PCE, as well as a mixture of the two, and a discussion of disease manifestations potentially associated with such exposure.  Fourteen diseases (to include adult leukemia) were identified as having limited/suggestive evidence of an association with TCE, PCE, or a solvent mixture exposure,.  NRC uses the category \"limited/suggestive evidence of an association\" when the evidence is \"limited by the inability to rule out chance and bias, including confounding, with confidence.\"  The NRC \"concluded that the epidemiological studies give some reason to be concerned that sufficiently high levels of the chemical may cause the disease, but the studies do not provide strong evidence that they actually do so.\"  \r\n\r\nOn December 2011 VA examination (by a family practitioner) CLL was diagnosed; the examiner opined that the Veteran's CLL is less likely than not incurred in service because \"CLL has not been causally related to Camp Lejeune water contamination.  There is only 'limited or suggestive' evidence of association not meeting the level of causation.\"  In a January 2012 addendum, the examiner noted that the Veteran had no family history of leukemia, pre or post-service carcinogen exposure, or other occupational exposure (i.e., no other known risk factors)..  \r\n\r\nIn a January 2012 advisory opinion, a Veterans Service Center Manager recommended denial of the Veteran's claim \"[b]ased on a lack of medical evidence showing a link between the exposure and the veteran's CLL.\"  \r\nAn April 2012 treatment report from P. W. Gonter, M.D., the Veteran's oncologist, notes he had \"low-grade lymphoma/leukemia with excellent response to chemotheraphy.\"  It also notes his service at Camp Lejeune which \"had a substantial elevation amount benzene in the water\" and includes the opinion that \"[i]t is well known that benzene can induce hematological malignancies and I think it is reasonable to conclude that this exposure to a high level of benzene may have an influencing effect on development of leukemia/lymphoma.\"  \r\n\r\nThere are conflicting medical opinions regarding a nexus between the Veteran's CLL and his acknowledged exposure to contaminants in the water supply where he was stationed in service.  The VA examiner's opinion (by a family practitioner) against the claim concedes there may be a nexus, but observes that the evidence of such has not yet reached \"the level of causation\".  The private provider's opinion (supporting the claim) is by a specialist in the specific medical field (an oncologist); cites to the state of medical knowledge (\"it is known that benzene can influence hematological malignancies\"); and is by a provider who (like the VA examiner) exhibits familiarity with the factual record.'  The Board finds that it is competent and probative evidence in the matter at hand.  Comparing the evidence for and against the Veteran's claim, the Board finds it in equipoise.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, as required (see38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102), the Board concludes that the requirements for establishing service connection are met; service connection for CLL is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for CLL is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

The Board had previously remanded the issue on appeal in June 2012 and March 2013 for additional development.  In June 2013, the Board, in pertinent part, denied service connection for a low back disability.  The issue then became the subject of a February 2014 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) and Order of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), which vacated that portion of the June 2013 decision that denied service connection for a low back disability and remanded the matter for compliance with the terms of the JMPR.  In June 2014, the Board again remanded the issue for additional development.  As the actions specified in the remand have been completed, the matter has been properly returned to the Board for appellate consideration.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been processed through the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) electronic paperless appeals processing system.\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's current degenerative disc disease (DDD) and degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the lumbar spine are etiologically related to low back pain he sustained following an in-service parachute jump incident.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for DDD and DJD of the lumbar spine have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2014).\r\n\r\nGiven the Board's favorable decision in granting service connection for a low back disability, the Board finds that all notification and development actions needed to fairly adjudicate the appeal have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for a claimed disorder on a direct basis, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nCertain chronic diseases, including arthritis, may be presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309 (2014).  \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the provisions relating to presumptive service connection, a Veteran may establish service connection for a disability with proof of actual direct causation.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).\r\n\r\nA layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his or her current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if: (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition; (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that in 1953, while training at jump school, he landed in a gully, following a parachute jump, and injured his back.  He asserts that he sought treatment from the drop zone medic who found that the Veteran had a strained or sprained muscle and gave him aspirin.  See January 2009 statement.  The Veteran came home on leave after his parachute jump training in late 1953 or early 1954.  His ex-wife and his brother said he reported his jump injury, complained of back pain, and explained that he was told it was muscle spasms which were treated with aspirin.  See January 2009 and August 2012 statements.  He had gone to a civilian doctor while on leave, after he kept having back pain from marches and prolonged standing, and received the same diagnosis with a prescription for muscle relaxers for the pain.  See March 2009 statement.  A family friend, who had known him since 1964, said that he witnessed the Veteran's complaints of back pain through the years.  See March 2009 statement.  The Veteran continued to experience back pain since his separation from service until he said he had to go the hospital twice with severe back pain and learned that he had severe disc problem.  See March 2009 and August 2012 statements.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was as a Light Weapons Infantryman and Rotary Wing Aviator.  He successfully completed Basic Airborne training over three weeks in 1953 and he received a Parachute Badge.  He also completed 22 weeks of training in 1955 as a cargo helicopter pilot.  Based on the Veteran's military records, the Board finds that the Veteran's reported in-service injury is consistent with the circumstances of his service.  \r\n\r\nService treatment records from April 1953 to July 1958 are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of any back problems.  At separation, his July 1958 examination showed normal clinical evaluation results with no reported back problems.  Subsequent Army Reserve examinations were also normal.  See April 1976, January 1977, and July 1978 examinations.\r\n\r\nA November 1998 private MRI report reveals that the Veteran had degenerative spurring along the lower lumbar vertebral bodies, most marked at the level of L4-5 with associated mild narrowing of the intervertebral disc space and degenerative changes in the lower lumbar facet joints.  \r\n\r\nA July 2005 private treatment record reflects that the Veteran complained of low back pain after riding his lawn mower a couple of days earlier.  He had described having similar symptoms in the past.  Upon objective evaluation, the Veteran was diagnosed with mechanical back pain.  \r\n\r\nAn August 2005 private treatment documents that the Veteran reported having low back pain radiating to his bilateral lower extremities.  He had been to physical therapy.  His pain was presently controlled, but could suddenly become worse, such as when sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time.  The private treating physician noted that the Veteran's MRI showed disc herniation at L2-3 predominately on the right.  \r\n\r\nA November 2005 private record reflects that the Veteran had received lumbar spine injections with moderate relief of the low back pain.  The Veteran was still unable to ambulate for any great distance without significant pain.  The private treating physician recommended that the Veteran continue to receive repeated injections and be evaluated again in six months.  \r\n\r\nA December 2005 private treatment record reflects that the Veteran's treatment with epidural injections had failed.  The private treating physician explained that a decompression laminectomy and fusion would be a significantly large operation and offered the Veteran a spinal cord stimulator trial.\r\n\r\nIn January 2006, the Veteran underwent surgery for insertion of a spinal cord stimulator.  The post-operative diagnosis was lumbar spondylosis with radiculopathy.  \r\n\r\nPrivate treatment records following the Veteran' surgery document that the Veteran's low back pain had improved.  See February 2006, March 2006, and April 2007 private treatment records.  August 2008 and January 2009 private treatment records document that the Veteran's low back pain was worsening and his spinal cord stimulator was not charged.  \r\n\r\nAt a February 2010 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he had served as a cargo helicopter pilot during his active duty service and that he worked as a helicopter pilot for many years following his discharge.  In the past five or six years, he had worked as an apartment manager until he retired due to problems with his low back and knees.  He reported his 1953 in-service parachute landing, his having sought treatment from a medic and his pulled muscle diagnosis.  The VA examiner noted that there was no record of treatment for back pain in his service treatment records and that his separation examination was also silent.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's report that after separation, he had intermittent low back pain and sought chiropractic treatment for 10 years.  The Veteran had experienced worsening low back pain over the years and more recently had severe lower abdominal wall pain causing him to call an ambulance.  The Veteran had tried physical therapy, epidural spinal injections and a spinal cord stimulator, which provided no long-term relief.  He currently used Vicodin to treat his low back pain.  An x-ray revealed moderate lumbar spondylosis.  Upon objective evaluation, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine.  Based on a lack of documented treatment for low back problems in service or during the 45 years following service, the Veteran's diagnosis of degenerative disc disease in the last six years, and no current evidence of severe limitation of range of motion with moderate functional limitations due to his back, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's severe low back disability was less likely as not related to his military service.  \r\n\r\nA January 2011 private MRI report revealed that the Veteran had multilevel DDD with a mild to moderate central canal stenosis at the L2-L3 and L4-L5 levels.  \r\n\r\nA May 2011 private treatment record documents that the Veteran had undergone surgery for lumbar decompression and fusion of L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2012, the February 2010 VA examiner provided an addendum etiological opinion.  The VA examiner addressed the lay statements describing the Veteran's in-service parachute injury and subsequent back pain along with their description of his post-service treatment for back pain.  For her opinion, the VA examiner continued to rely on the lack of documented medical records during military service or during the intervening years since his discharge until 2005.  The VA examiner also found significant the Veteran's post-service occupational history as a helicopter pilot.  She said it involved repeated load-bearing stresses on the spine and that it was not uncommon to develop multilevel DDD of the lumbar spine as a result.  The VA examiner repeated her original negative etiological opinion for the Veteran's low back disability.  \r\n\r\nIn a March 2014 statement, Dr. Graven, the Veteran's private treating physician, explained that he had been treating the Veteran for the last several years, that the Veteran had spinal stenosis and degenerative disc and joint disease of the lumbar facets, and that he was incapacitated on a regular basis because of his disability.  Dr. Graven noted that the Veteran had sustained an injury while parachuting during his military service and that he had sought treatment for several months following his injury.  Dr. Graven opined that the Veteran's current low back disability was at least as likely as not related to his military service.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted an April 2014 private opinion from Dr. Ali.  Dr. Ali indicated that she had reviewed the Veteran's in-service and post-service medical records, including his VA examinations.  Dr. Ali disagreed with the December 2012 VA examiner's opinion and found that the VA examiner failed to consider that if the Veteran had sustained an in-service back injury then that injury would have compounded the occupational stressors and natural aging process of the spine.  Dr. Ali explained that the course of a back injury would wax and wane and might ultimately become progressively worse if conservative treatment failed.  Dr. Ali also stated that MRIs, which were not available during the 1950's, were the best way to identify discogenic disease as x-ray findings might only become apparent after several years.  Dr. Ali found that the Veteran had an acute injury that had evolved into a chronic problem with acute flares.  In addition, Dr. Ali said that the Veteran's back disability was not part of the natural aging process as it was not natural to continue to have chronic back pain with numerous flare-ups.  The lack of treatment records for back problems during service was not found to be significant, because Dr. Ali found that the type of accident the Veteran had during service was consistent with and could cause his current low back disability.  Dr. Ali opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's current low back disability was related to, or caused by, the Veteran's 1953 parachute jump injury.  \r\n\r\nIn an August 2014 VA opinion, the February 2010 VA examiner continued to find the lack of objective medical evidence both during service and for many years following service significant to the finding that the Veteran's low back disability was less likely than not related to his 1953 in-service injury.  The VA examiner relied on the Veteran's lack of reported back complaints despite having received numerous treatment for his knees.  The VA examiner also found it significant that once the Veteran had been diagnosed with a low back disability in 1998, his back had only mild degenerative changes.  \r\n\r\nBased on a careful review of the evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran's current DDD and DJD of the lumbar spine are related to his reported in-service 1953 parachute injury where he landed in a gully and injured his back.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the lay statements describing the in-service parachute incident along with the subsequent report of back pain and treatment, the recurring complaints of back pain following service, and the chiropractic treatment he received for several years after service are competent and credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. at 470.  Despite the lack of documented medical treatment for his low back pain until 1998, the Veteran, his ex-wife, brother, and friend all stated that the Veteran had consistently complained of back problems during service which became worse over the years.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran has provided sufficient evidence that he experienced back pain during service and that such back pain continued for many years following his separation.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence demonstrates, and the competing etiological medical opinions agree, that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for DDD and DJD of the lumbar spine.  However, the April 2014 private opinion of Dr. Ali and the August 2014 VA opinion disagree as to the etiology of the Veteran's currently diagnosed low back disability.  The probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board.  See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993).  When reviewing such medical opinions, the Board may appropriately favor the opinion of one competent medical authority over another.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).  However, the Board may not reject medical opinions based on its own medical judgment.  Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30 (1993); see also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).  Here, the Board finds that the April 2014 private opinion and August 2014 VA opinion are of equal probative value as they are both based on a review of the Veteran's medical records and consideration of the lay statements.  The opinions are also supported by a complete rationale.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Board assigns more probative weight to the April 2014 private opinion as it afforded more significance to the competent and credible lay statements and provided a thorough rationale for the lack of documented medical evidence of back treatment for years after the Veteran's discharge.  Furthermore, the April 2014 private opinion specifically found that the Veteran's in-service injury was consistent with his current low back diagnosis.  Therefore, the Board finds that the April 2014 private opinion offers the most probative evidence as to the etiology of the Veteran's low back disability.  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran is entitled to service connection for a low back disability, and therefore, service connection must be granted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; Gilbert v.

A hearing was scheduled for September 2014, but the Veteran failed to appear.  It appears that notice of the hearing was sent to the address listed by the Veteran on his substantive appeal.  As the Board has received no request for a postponement or good cause for the Veteran's failure to appear, his hearing request is deemed withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.704(d) (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's myelodysplastic syndrome has been medically linked to his exposure to Agent Orange during service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for myelodysplastic syndrome have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1116, 1154, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(e) (2014).\r\n \r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn this decision, the Board grants service connection for myelodysplastic syndrome.  As this represents a complete grant of the benefit sought on appeal, no discussion of VA's duty to notify and assist is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome since February 2012.  The Veteran maintains that this condition is due to his exposure to tactical herbicides, specifically Agent Orange, during his service in the Republic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).  \r\n\r\nWhere, as here, a veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam between January 1962 and May 1975, he shall be presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, including Agent Orange.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309.\r\n\r\nAlthough myelodysplastic syndrome is not one of the conditions that is presumptively related to tactical herbicide exposure, the unavailability of presumptive service connection for a disability based on exposure to herbicides does not preclude a Veteran from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).\r\n\r\nDeterminations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical and lay evidence, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  When there is an approximate balance of evidence for and against the issue, all reasonable doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the Veteran's service and Vietnam and current diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome have been conceded.  The only question before the Board is whether the Veteran's current condition is related to his exposure to herbicides during service.  \r\n\r\nIn support of his claim the Veteran has submitted an August 2013 letter from his treating oncologist which reflects the opinion that the Veteran's myelodysplastic syndrome is more likely than not related to his exposure to Agent Orange.  In support of this opinion the letter notes that myelodysplasia is similar to other hematologic malignancies that are presumptively associated with herbicide exposure and that the condition is a precursor to frank leukemia. \r\n\r\nAlthough the letter does not offer a thorough explanation of the relationship between the Veteran's condition and herbicide exposure and is speculative in its terminology, the letter is based on the Veteran's treatment history and it is unrebutted by other medical opinion of record.  As such, the evidence is in relative equipoise concerning a nexus between the Veteran's service and his present disability.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).  Therefore, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for myelodysplastic syndrome is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for myelodysplastic syndrome is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nSteven D.

Parke, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty from November 1968 to April 1970.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In February 2013, the Board remanded the claim for additional development and adjudicative action. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nWith resolution of the doubt in his favor, the Veteran's anxiety disorder was caused by military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria to establish service connection for an anxiety disorder are approximated. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101 , 1110, 1112, 1137, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102 , 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(a) (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is in receipt of service connection for a major depressive disorder. Development has been undertaken. However, review of the evidence indicates that no further development under the law would substantially assist the Board in this determination. \r\n\r\nThe law provides that under the benefit of the doubt doctrine, where it is not possible to distinguish the effects of a nonservice-connected condition from those of a service-connected condition, the reasonable doubt doctrine dictates that all symptoms be attributed to the Veteran's service-connected disability. Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998). Service connection will therefore be granted. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Board expresses no opinion regarding the severity of the disorder. The RO will assign an appropriate disability rating on receipt of this decision. Ferenc v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 58 (2006) (discussing the distinction in the terms \"compensation,\" \"rating,\" and \"service connection\" as although related, each having a distinct meaning as specified by Congress); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.14 (the evaluation of the \" same disability \" or the \" same manifestation \" under various diagnoses is to be avoided) and Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994) (while pyramiding of disabilities is to be avoided pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 1155  and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.14 , it is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury permitting two different disability ratings). \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER \r\n\r\nService connection for an anxiety disorder is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nVITO A.

Nelson, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served in the Army National Guard for more than 20 years, including a period of verified active duty from January 2008 to January 2009.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2011 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New York, New York, which denied service connection for the claimed disability.\r\n\r\nIn October 2014, the Veteran testified at a Central Office hearing before a Veterans Law Judge and a transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and the evidence is in relative equipoise on the question of whether the sleep apnea is related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  When VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, it is required to notify the claimant and the representative, if any, of any information and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b).  \r\n\r\nAs the Board is granting the claim for service connection for sleep apnea, the claim is substantiated and there are no further actions necessary on the part of VA to notify or assist.  Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet App 362, 367- 68 (2001); see also 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(a)(2) (secretary not required to provide assistance \"if no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim\").\r\n\r\nLaw and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted for disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 113; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nService connection requires competent evidence showing (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004), citing Hansen v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 110, 111 (2002); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  Service connection may be also granted on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disorder.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310(a) (2013); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).\r\n\r\nWith disability compensation claims, VA adjudicators are directed to assess both medical and lay evidence.  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a competent source.  Second, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007).  Third, the Board must weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.\r\n\r\nCompetent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.  Competent medical evidence may include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises, and may also include statements from authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(1).\r\n\r\nCompetent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  A layperson is not generally capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(2); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nOnce the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7104(a).  The Secretary shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  In weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.  See generally Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  The Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence in determining credibility, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006); but see Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint after service can be considered along with other factors in the analysis of a service connection claim).  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7105; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 4.3.  When a claimant seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the claimant prevails.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-54 (1990).  The preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim for benefits to be denied.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he developed sleep apnea when he was deployed to Afghanistan from 2008 to 2009.  See the November 2013 VA Form 9.  \r\n\r\nIn November 2009, the Veteran reported symptoms of sleep apnea, including snoring, during an appointment with a VA social worker.  In December 2009, the Veteran had a VA pulmonary sleep clinic consultation, in which he reported symptoms of snoring, witnessed apnea, frequent awakenings, unrefreshing sleep, restless sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness.  The consulting physician opined that the Veteran's symptoms were consistent with obstructive sleep apnea.  In January 2010, after a full-night sleep study at VA, the Veteran was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea with severe sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia.  Thus, the current disability requirement for service connection for sleep apnea is satisfied.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence is in relative equipoise on the issue of whether the sleep apnea is etiologically related to active service.  The Veteran's private physician, Dr. R.M., submitted a statement in January 2012 indicating that he has treated the Veteran since 2002, and that prior to the Veteran's deployment in January 2008, he never exhibited signs or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.  Dr. R.M. further stated that since the Veteran's return from deployment in January 2009, it had been concluded that the Veteran had developed obstructive sleep apnea and he has been successfully treated since approximately August 2010 with a CPAP machine.\r\n\r\nIn support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a lay statement in October 2014 from Mr. M.C., who served with the Veteran in various military assignments from 1997 to 2006.  M.C. stated that he lived in close quarters with the Veteran, and prior to the Veteran's deployment, he did not witness any snoring or unusual sleep patterns.  In August 2008, however, the Veteran was home on leave from Afghanistan, and M.C. noticed when he spent a few days with the Veteran that he would take frequent naps during the day, snored loudly at night, and appeared to wake up frequently at night.  Moreover, in January 2009, M.C. spent some weekends with the Veteran, where he noticed the same sleeping symptoms but they appeared to have worsened.  M.C. stated also that he has been diagnosed with sleep apnea himself and uses CPAP therapy, so he suggested the Veteran have a sleep study done.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran also testified at a Central Office hearing before a Veteran's Law Judge in October 2014.  The Veteran testified that prior to his deployment in January 2008, he did not have any sleep apnea.  He stated that in Afghanistan, he began having symptoms including feeling tired during the daytime, nausea, headaches, and waking up and being out of breath.  He also stated that during a two-week mid-tour leave, his wife told him that he stopped breathing at night and she would stay awake watching him at night to make sure nothing else happened.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's wife also testified in the October 2014 hearing, stating that before his deployment to Afghanistan, the Veteran slept peacefully and she did not notice any problems in his sleep patterns.  In August 2008, however, when the Veteran came home for two weeks in the middle of his deployment, he woke her up at night due to the sound of his snoring.  She stated that his snoring would be followed by 10 to 20 seconds of silence, and that she would wake him up several times each night.  She also stated that the Veteran's other symptoms including being unexplainably tired during the day, napping during the day, complaining of headaches, and weight gain.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. K.R., who was in the Veteran's Army National Guard unit and was deployed to Afghanistan with the Veteran, also testified at the October 2014 hearing.  He stated that he has known the Veteran for more than 20 years, and that prior to Afghanistan he never observed the Veteran to complain of headaches, and when they shared rooms he did not observe that the Veteran snored.  K.R. stated that in Afghanistan, he did not observe the Veteran having any sleeping problems for the first 20 to 30 nights.  After that, however, he noticed that the Veteran was going to bed later at night, getting more tired during the day, and snoring at night.  K.R. further stated that on a plane ride home he observed that the Veteran was sleeping and snoring progressively louder, and would then stop and wake up, then go back to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds all of the lay statements to be competent and credible.  The Veteran's statements and the statements of the Veteran's wife and fellow soldiers are credible because they have been consistent and are consistent with the Veteran's medical diagnosis.  The Veteran is competent to describe observable symptoms of daytime tiredness, headaches, waking frequently at night.  The Veteran's wife, M.C., and K.R. are also competent to describe observable symptoms snoring, several seconds of silence followed by waking up, and taking naps during the day.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Medical knowledge is not required to competently observe these symptoms.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the opinion by Dr. R.M. is of limited probative value because Dr. R.M. did not diagnose the Veteran with sleep apnea and he did not specifically opine that the sleep apnea is etiologically related to the Veteran's service.  There can be no doubt that further medical inquiry could be undertaken with a view towards development of the claim.  Specifically, the Board could seek further examination or medical opinion to aid in determining the etiology of the current sleep apnea.  However, under the law, where there exists \"an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter,\" the Veteran shall prevail upon the issue.  Ashley v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 52, 59 (1993); see also Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204, 206-207 (1994).  Here, the Veteran and 3 lay witnesses have competently and credibly testified that the sleep apnea started during the Veteran's active service in 2008, and Dr. R.M. indicated that prior to the Veteran's deployment in January 2008, he never exhibited signs or symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.  The Board also finds it significant that the Veteran reported to VA that he had symptoms of sleep apnea in November 2009, less than one year after his separation from active service.\r\n\r\nThus, as there is \"an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter,\" the Board finds that this is a situation where the benefit of the doubt rule applies.  Ashley, 6 Vet. App. at 59; 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.  In resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the onset of the sleep apnea was during service and service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for sleep apnea is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nH.

Reg. 49,747 (1992).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nGenerally, to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called \"nexus\" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss as directly related to his period of active service.  For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385 (2015).\r\n\r\nThe report of an April 2010 VA examination indicates the Veteran has been diagnosed with hearing loss of the right ear for VA purposes.  Furthermore, given the Veteran's military occupational specialty in the artillery, in-service acoustic trauma has been established.  See , e.g., November 1969 DD Form-214.  The remaining question, therefore, is whether the Veteran's current right ear hearing loss is etiologically related to his in-service acoustic trauma.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Board observes that the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran experienced hearing loss of the right ear for VA purposes during either period of active service.  However, the report of a March 1979 audiogram, performed shortly before the Veteran's separation from his second period of active service, indicates a hearing threshold level of approximately 25-30 decibels (dB) in the 3000 MHz range.  While such a finding does not amount to hearing loss for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385, it does indicate some level of hearing loss.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993) (the threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss).  As a May 1975 audiogram indicates hearing thresholds below 20 dB throughout the range of testing, the Board finds there was no hearing loss at service entrance.\r\n\r\nIn reaching its determination that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is related to his in-service acoustic trauma, the Board is cognizant that there is no competent medical opinion linking the two.  Significantly, however, there is no adequate negative etiological opinion on which to deny the Veteran the benefit sought. \r\n\r\n\"A veteran need only demonstrate that there is an 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence' in order to prevail.\"  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  Entitlement need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence, or by a fair preponderance of the evidence.  Under the benefit of the doubt doctrine established by Congress, when the evidence is in \"relative equipoise, the law dictates that the veteran prevails.\"  Id. \r\n\r\nAs the March 1979 audiogram indicates at least some level of hearing loss at service separation, and in the absence of any competent negative medical opinion, the Board finds the evidence is at least is equipoise that the Veteran's current right ear hearing loss is etiologically related to his active service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nGAYLE E.

Sorathia, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1969 to March 1971, with service in the Republic of Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Jackson, Mississippi. \r\n\r\nThe service connection claim for PTSD was previously denied in a January 2002 rating decision.  Since this denial of the Veteran's claim, there has been a liberalizing law creating a new evidentiary standard for which a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD can be substantiated under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f).  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39843 (July 13, 2010).  Therefore, the Veteran's claim will be reviewed on a de novo basis as opposed to a new and material basis.  See Ervin v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 318, 320-21 (2011) (discussing a \"liberalizing\" amendment to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) that allows, in some circumstances, for a noncombat Veteran's lay testimony to establish the occurrence of a claimed stressor); Spencer v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 283, 288-89 (1993), aff'd 17 F.3d 368 (Fed. Cir. 1994); see also Helms v. Shinseki, No. 12-0310, 2013 WL 3779222, at *1 (Vet. App. July 19, 2013) (stating that \"Because the Board erred in finding that an amendment to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) was not a liberalizing change in the law, the Court will vacate\" the Board decision).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2016.  A transcript of this hearing is associated with the claims file. \r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2015).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, which has been rendered by a VA psychologist. \r\n\r\n2.  The diagnosis of PTSD is related, at least in part, to stressors based on his service in Vietnam.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303, 3.304(f) (2015).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a) (2015); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred, unless the stressor is related to a Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) (2015). \r\n\r\nHere, the Veteran contends that his PTSD is related to service, specifically his service in the Republic of Vietnam.  He states that he has nightmares of his experiences in Vietnam, including a rocket attack.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's wife testified during the April 2016 hearing and submitted lay statements in March 2002 and March 2009.  She explained that she knew her husband before he went to Vietnam and began dating him upon his return from Vietnam.  She described changes in his personality and behavior after his separation from service.    \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded VA examinations during the course of the appeal.  A May 2002 VA examiner stated that although the Veteran had features of PTSD, he did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  However, the examiner further stated that the Veteran had \"obvious features\" of PTSD which are \"probably a result of his military service in Vietnam.\"  August 2011 and May 2015 VA examiners found that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the Veteran's VA treatment records from 2001 to the present include a diagnosis of PTSD rendered by a VA psychologist.  These records include several discussions of the Veteran's experiences in Vietnam.  A November 2001 treatment record noted the \"parallel between his anger/hypervigilance and his Vietnam experiences.\"  During a July 2005 mental health session, the Veteran discussed his psychiatric symptoms and his experiences in Vietnam.  The VA psychologist then rendered a diagnosis of PTSD.  A March 2009 treatment record included a diagnosis of PTSD and noted that the Veteran's time in Vietnam \"changed him.\"  Also of record is a June 2015 VA treatment record.  The VA psychologist evaluated the Veteran at length.  The VA psychologist stated that testing results and interview data supported the diagnosis of PTSD.  The treatment notes from this date include discussion of the Veteran's Vietnam experience and reveal that the Veteran's reported criterion A stressors related to service, specifically including service in Vietnam.             \r\n\r\nGiven the extensive VA treatment records noting a diagnosis of PTSD, including notations of PTSD rendered by multiple VA psychologists, and after resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds it significant that the May 2002 VA examiner stated that the Veteran had \"obvious features\" of PTSD which are \"probably a result of his military service in Vietnam.\"  It is also significant that the VA treatment records include a diagnosis of PTSD rendered by VA psychologists based on service-related stressors, specifically stressors related to his Vietnam experiences.  After resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that he has a current diagnosis of PTSD based on his experiences in Vietnam.  The Veteran has indicated that a grant of any psychiatric disorder would satisfy his appeal.  Thus, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f)(3), service connection for PTSD is warranted.     \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nSTEVEN D.

E. Wilkerson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from December 1973 to October 1981.\r\n\r\nThis matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2008 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Phoenix, Arizona. Thereafter, the Veteran's claims file was transferred to the RO in Reno, Nevada.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011, the Veteran testified at a Travel Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge. A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file.\r\n\r\nIn August 2013, the Board remanded the matter to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) for additional development.  The case has since returned to the Board for the purpose of appellate disposition.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Virtual VA and VBMS paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this Veteran's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's current low back disability, diagnosed degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, status post L4-L5-S1 fusion, was incurred in service as a result a documented fall in March 1979.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nDegenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, status post L4-L5-S1 fusion, was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2014)) redefined VA's duty to assist the Veteran in the development of a claim. VA regulations for the implementation of VCAA were codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).\r\n\r\nGiven the favorable disposition of the claim for service connection for low back disability, the Board finds that all notification and development actions needed to fairly adjudicate the claim have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nII.  Factual Background\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records include report of a fall downstairs at home in March 1979.  Treatment records from the date of the fall note that the Veteran presented apparently paralyzed from the waist down.  It was noted that he had drunk 3 beers and 3 shots of liquor that evening.  He was unconscious for 20 to 25 minutes.  He had a laceration and hematoma on the back of the shoulders, and denied any feeling in the legs and left arm.  He was without Babinski response bilaterally.  A laboratory report from the day of the fall references Diagnostic Code 7228.  \r\n\r\nApproximately 2 hours later, he was able to move the right toes and right knee, but still had no sensation above the L4-5 area.  Right Babinski was negative while left Babinski was positive.  He was assessed with rule-out cerebral hematoma and transferred to the VA hospital with copies of x-rays, though the x-rays are not of record.  A report notes that he was seen at the emergency room in Nashville but not admitted.  Observation of head injury was indicated.  \r\n\r\nSubsequently, an abbreviated clinical record (dated April 3, 1979, with notation that the original report was missing) indicates that the Veteran was admitted for observation at Fort Campbell after presenting to the emergency department with complaint of being paralyzed from the waist down.  He was transferred to neurosurgery services for evaluation, but completely recovered on route.  When he was seen at neurosurgery services, he was found to be completely normal, and so returned for observation.  At that time, a physical examination was normal except for a bruised occiput.  He was returned to duty with no reported complaints or problems 2 days after the fall. \r\n\r\nPersonnel records reflect that he was placed on \"casual\" status in April 1979 and subsequently transferred to Germany in early May 1979.  \r\n\r\nService personnel records also reflect that the Veteran was reduced in rank the day following the documented fall, but re-promoted to the same rank approximately 2 weeks later.  \r\n\r\nOn report of medical history in August 1981, the Veteran denied recurrent back pain, neuritis, and paralysis.  The spine was noted to be normal on August 1981 separation examination.  Personnel records reflect that the Veteran was discharged due to alcohol abuse and failed rehabilitation.  \r\n\r\nA November 1992 private treatment report reflects that a CT scan was consistent with grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 level with what seemed to be spinal stenosis and a herniated disc at L4-L5.  He was recommended for spinal fusion surgery.\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that the Veteran initially filed for SSA benefits in 1992 and was granted benefits for a temporary period.  In his December 1992 application for disability, the appellant's self-reported history of his claimed back disability indicated that in June 1990, his family physician referred him to Dr. K., who reportedly diagnosed a fractured spine.  A work history report notes that the Veteran reported that his duties as a crane operator included lifting and 10-ton ball and resetting it.  He walked the crane and \"hocked heavy chains\" 8 hours a day.  He reported frequent bending and reaching.  He indicated that the crane did the heavy lifting.  He noted previous employment as an expeditor.  \r\n\r\nA job summary/physical capacities report completed by the Veteran noted that as a crane operator, he unloaded and loaded barges, trucks, and railroad cars, and broke iron and steel.  His job required lifting object of 50-100 pounds.  As an expeditor, his duties included carrying material specific to the job and loading and unloading trucks, also requiring lifting of objects weighing 50-100 pounds.  The Veteran reported that he worked as an expeditor from 1987 to 1989, which included loading trucks and operating a crane, while he started as a crane operator in 1989.  \r\n\r\nA February 1993 statement from Dr. S. of the Northwest Indiana Spinal Surgery indicated that the Veteran had recently undergone surgery, which had consisted of measured anterior/posterior reconstruction and fusion. However, prior to this surgery he underwent \"five other back surgeries\" and he continued to be symptomatic.\r\n\r\nA March 1993 history and physical by Dr. P. noted that the appellant initially presented with complaints of back pain necessitating hospitalization and work-up in July 1990. Diagnostic testing and evaluation at that time revealed a central disc herniation at the L4-5 level, significant central and lateral disc herniations, and borderline spinal stenosis.  An unnamed orthopedist initiated physical therapy which did not provide relief, so an anesthesiologist performed an epidural injection.\r\n\r\nA June 1993 written statement from Dr. S. reflects that the Veteran presented at an emergency room in November 1992 for evaluation.  He was a crane operator and presented with a 3-week history of low back pain and bilateral lower extremity radiation.  The pain had been present for 2 years, but one and off.   He had been treated by a Dr. K., who informed he had a cracked spine and was given epidural injection, but it did not help.  He stopped working because the pain had become intolerable.  It was noted that he was not responsive to prior conservative treatment and surgery was recommended.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA November 1993 report from private physician Dr. G. notes that the Veteran originally injured his back in 1979, when he fell 130 feet.  He stated that his lower extremities were paralyzed for a period of 2 months, but he gradually recovered.  He reported intermittent problems with back pain and lower extremity pain and numbness.  He worked as a crane operator for the past 4 years, when his back problems became more severe and eventually unbearable.  He was last able to work in October of 1992, at which time he was barely able to walk. He did not experience any new injury.  He underwent surgical decompression surgery in January 1993.  Preoperative x-rays showed a degenerative spondylolisthesis the L4-5 level. The preoperative CAT scan showed bilateral foraminal stenosis at L4-5. There was good maintenance of the disc spaces. A postoperative x-ray showed a posterolateral fusion from L4 to the sacrum.\r\n\r\nA March 1994 VA examination report notes a diagnosis of suspect nerve root irritation L4-L5 with root impingement.  Neurologically, evaluation and EMG studies were recommended.  \r\n\r\nA September 2001 disability pension application completed by Dr. G. indicates that the Veteran was totally and permanently disabled due to on-the-job injury with advanced degenerative disc disease of the spine.  \r\n\r\nA SSA work history report completed by the Veteran in November 2005 reflects that he worked as a heavy equipment and crane operator from 1980 to 2005.  He reported that he frequently lifted objects that were 50 pounds or more for this position, and that his job duties required standing, sitting, climbing, stooping, reaching, and handling or grasping large objects.  \r\n\r\nOn VA examination in February 2008, the examiner noted that review of the claims file revealed that the Veteran fell down stairs in March 1979 and sustained a head injury and transient loss of feeling from the waist down.  Examination was normal except for a bruise on the occiput of the head.  He was initially transferred to neurology service in Nashville, but was not admitted as he had complete resolution of symptoms and was returned to duty in 2 days.  He was not released form active service until October 1981, 2.5 years after the injury, and at that time he had no evidence of paralysis or residuals of that head injury.  The examiner further noted that private treatment records dated in November 1992 showed a 3-week history of back and lower extremity pain, with intermittent symptoms occurring for the past 2 years.  The examiner also discussed the 2001 disability pension application and VA treatment records noting the Veteran's report that he \"broke his back\" in service.  \r\n\r\nAt that time, the Veteran stated that he fell down stairs in service and was paralyzed for 2 days.  He also stated that he was hit in the head.  He stated that he was treated with morphine and then released, and also had 90-days of leave for recovery.  He stated that the condition worsened, required surgery, including fusion.  He continued to experienced chronic low back pain.  \r\n\r\nAfter physical examination and x-ray, the examiner diagnosed degenerative disc disease of the lumbosacral spine with right lower extremity radiculopathy.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's current low back condition was not caused by or a result of service-related transient loss of sensation from the waist down after head injury in March 1979.  In so finding, the examiner noted that there was no evidence of current paralysis of L4-5 or from the waist down; rather, this was a transient complaint post head injury.  There was no evidence of back or spine injury in service.  Examination at the time of head injury was only abnormal for a bruise on the occiput.  He was returned to normal duty 2 days and served another 2.5 years.  He had evidence of a back condition starting while working as a crane operator in approximately 1991, some 10 years post service with evidence of a herniated disc requiring decompression, and spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis with instability requiring fusion.  The examiner determined that the spine surgery was most likely due to the herniated nucleus pulposus, which occurred while operating a crane.  Degenerative disc disease most likely due to the original herniated nucleus pulposus with spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, status post surgery with resulting secondary multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine-a common occurrence post fusion.  \r\n\r\nA February 2009 report from Dr. K. reflects the Veteran's report that he fell down stairs in service and lost feeling in his legs.  He indicated that he was given a desk job after the injury before he retired.  He reported continued problems since the initial injury.  Dr. K. noted that he reviewed the Veteran's service treatment report which documenting a fall down stairs and observation for a head injury.  He also noted that a 1992 myelogram was included in his chart and reviewed, and that it showed herniated disc at L4-L5 and spondylosis.  After physical examination, the examiner diagnosed failed back syndrome and history of fall leading to most of his problems; cervicalgia, mid-thoracic pain, and lower back pain all related to the injury he sustained.  \r\n\r\nA December 2009 VA treatment records reflects the Veteran's report that he was paralyzed in service, and after the injury and bed rest for 48 hours, he got the feeling back in his legs and he was sent back to service with light duty.  After this, he worked a desk job for two years.  He started to experience his legs collapsing on him after service and found a disc was broke.  He started to get epidurals with a spinal surgeon in 1982.  After service in 1993, he developed degenerative disc disease of the spine and was disabled in 2003.  The examiner assessed spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication.  \r\n\r\nA June 2010 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran reported a fall injury in service with continuous back pain since the injury.  After physical examination, the examiner diagnosed degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, status post L4-L5-S1 fusion.  \r\n\r\nAfter review of the claims file, the examiner opined that the claimed back disability is less likely as not caused by or a result of a fall injury in service.  In so finding, the examiner noted that the Veteran was kept under neurological observation after the fall, as the incident did involve drinking.  He apparently recovered fully within a few days.  There was no mention of any physical bruising on the lower back or actual tenderness besides numbness in the lower back.  He did not see much complaint of back pain in service over the succeeding 2.5 years.  Secondly, the examiner noted that crane operation is a fairly uncomfortable job that did place a fair amount of burden on the back with the jolting that occurred in the cabin.  The VA examiner noted that he had been a workman's compensation physician for 8 years prior to working for VA, and had extensive experience in back-related issues in crane operators.  Therefore, he found that it would be difficult to place the majority of the etiology of his current back issues on his fall injury in 1979, and not on his heavy equipment work done for 11 years from 1982 to 1993.\r\n\r\nA January 2011 report from Dr. M. notes a history of fall in March 1979, which resulted in back pain that did not improve.  The Veteran was released from service and worked as a crane operator for 3 years, but during this time had no documented or stated injury.  He struggled with work due to his back pain but the work was quite light and did not involve any repetitive bending or lifting.  Due to chronic low back pain, he eventually underwent lumbar fusion in 1993.  The Veteran underwent physical examination, after which Dr. M. noted an impression of fall in 1979 resulting in back pain, chronic low back pain with radiculitis, and status post lumbar decompression and subsequent lumbar fusion L4-S1.\r\n\r\nDr. M. opined that, since the Veteran was initially injured while in service in 1979, and had chronic low back pain ever since with no additional significant traumas, it is more likely than not that his present disability is due to the initial injury in 1979.\r\n\r\nOn a written statement dated in December 2010, the Veteran's coworker, R.Z., wrote that he worked alongside the Veteran when he was a contracted heavy equipment operator.  He did not believe that the Veteran ever suffered an injury as a result of his heavy equipment operating duties, nor had he ever heard of the Veteran complain of such an injury while they worked together.  He noted that it was common knowledge that the Veteran suffered a back injury previously while in service. \r\n\r\nA January 2011 report form Dr. M., a Board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon, noted that he examined the Veteran in January 2011, and diagnosed lumbar degenerative disc syndrome, lumbar postlaminect syndrome, lumbar radiculitis, and lumbar intervertebral disc disease.\r\n\r\nHe reported that the Veteran stated that his injury occurred in 1979 while on active duty.  He stated that his back was never the same and that he suffered from pain and episodes of numbness since the fall down the stairs.  He believed that the injury was the main cause of his inability to continue his military career and he was never given proper treatment while on active duty.  He stated that the injury was more severe than records in his limited medical records and that many of his military medical records were lost.\r\n\r\nAfter discharge, he sought VA treatment but was denied because he was not service-connected.  Over the years, his condition worsened, and while he worked as a crane operator, he was not required to perform any extraordinary heavy manual labor, nor did he suffer any traumatic injuries to his spine during that employment.  \r\n\r\nDr. M. indicated that he reviewed the Veteran's VA claims file and the history of accident his in military records, noting the pertinent findings from Fort Campbell discussed above.  He noted that the fact that the Veteran was place on no duty by the treating physician and convalescent leave for 49 days before his transfer to Germany is indicated that his injuries were more serious than recorded in the insufficient replacement form \"abbreviated clinical records\" written almost 23 days later.  In addition, a November 1993 statement from Dr. G. stated that the Veteran was totally disabled and that he had not sustained any new injuries during his period working as a crane operator.  \r\n\r\nDr. M. further noted that the Veteran had no other known risk factors that may have precipitated his current condition. In his personal experience and in medical literature, it is known that paralyses and numbness of the lower extremities and loss of sensation in the back are indicative of a spinal injury.  The fact that during triage the focus was on the head injury was not unusual, but did not rule out other injuries which would have likely occurred in a  fall down four flights of stairs.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dr. M. opined that, since the Veteran was initially injured while in service 1979 and has had chronic low back pain ever since with no additional significant traumas, it is more likely than not that his present disability related to the back is due to the initial injury in 1979.\r\n\r\nIn a written statement dated in January 2011, the Veteran's uncle wrote that he saw the Veteran a few times during service prior to the fall, and he never had any health issues.  He saw the Veteran after the fall, and he complained that his back hurt him constantly.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2011 written statement in support of his claim, the Veteran reported that when he was initially treated after the fall and transported to the Nashville VA Medical Center, he was told by paramedics that he had a \"huge knot\" on his lower back, but he could not feel it at the time because he was numb from the waist down.  He stated that he was given crutches upon his discharge from observation at Fort Campbell.  He reported that he did not at the time that he would be placed on \"casual\" duty, that he had been demoted, and that there were plans to transfer him to Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's attorney contended that the \"replacement abbreviated clinical record\" dated in April 1979 shortly after his transfer to Germany was not to provide an accurate report of his medical conditions, but was necessitated by the need to provide a sanitized medical record to clear the Veteran for transfer to Germany.  He also pointed out that all further diagnostic tests and x-rays studies were \"lost\" and that the replacement clinical record was in conflict with the Veterans version of the events.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran felt the knot on his back on a daily basis and it lasted for about a week and a half, until it finally went away.  He gradually regained full feeling in his legs.  He reported that he sought pain medication for his back when he went to Germany, but was told there was no medical records in his file at that time.  The Veteran also presented for treatment at the Lakeshore VA Medical Center 1993, and those records were also lost.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's attorney indicated that the Veteran had consistently reported that, since the fall, his paralyses and numbness lasted longer than stated in the limited records, that his back was never the same, and that he suffered chronic, constant, and ever-increased pain and episodes of numbness while on active duty.\r\n\r\nHe also noted that he sought treatment in 1981 at the VA in Indianapolis, but was denied because he was not service-connected. The Veteran's wife and uncle have also reported that the Veteran had experienced back pain since service.\r\n\r\nWith respect to post-service employment, the Veteran worked from 1981 to 1983 as a laundry manager at hotels, a steak cook, and restaurant manager.  From 1983 to 1989, he worked as a blueprint expeditor for an engineering company, which was a clerical position.  From 1989 to 1992, he worked as a crane/plant operator.  He indicated that the job consisted of sitting in an \"air\" seat and operating the controls of the crane with his hands and fingers. As a highly skilled position, he argued that it was inconceivable that a crane operator would jostle or jolt a load, as that would be extremely dangerous to others and damaging to the equipment.  Both occupations were regularly disrupted by lay-offs, strikes or contract renewals, so his actual time on the job was intermittent.  During this entire period of employment, he never had any traumatic injury to his back.\r\n\r\nHe further suggested that Dr. S.'s intake record reflecting a 2 year onset of low back pain was inconsistent with the body of other evidence and was more likely as not understood to mean that the Veteran's pain was not at that severe level until 2 years prior.  He noted that multiple examinations performed during the course of the Veteran's employment as a crane operator indicate that he did not suffer from additional injury.  \r\n\r\nIn a February 2011 statement, the Veteran's wife wrote that she and the Veteran had reconnected in 1982, and that she knew that he had back problems from his fall at Fort Campbell at that time.  She expressed that he had continuously experienced problems with his back since that time, and he had never injured his back at any job he had.  \r\n\r\nDuring the Veteran's May 2011 Board hearing, the Veteran, through his attorney, argued that the Veteran's service treatment records documented back injury at the time of the fall, evidenced by the numbness in his legs.  There were x-rays taken, but these were unavailable.  He also noted that the Diagnostic Code 7228 referenced on lab findings at that time referred to a potential back injury (722.8- post laminectomy syndrome).  The Veteran stated that he was medevaced from Fort Campbell to the Nashville VA Medical Center, and the paramedics stated that he had a grapefruit-sized knot in his spine, which he indicated persisted for weeks after the initial injury.  After he was discharged from the hospital, he was given crutches and pain medication.  He was immediately demoted then re-promoted.  The Veteran's attorney contended that the Veteran's record was sanitized so that he could be transferred to Germany.  The Veteran reported that he did not suffer from any subsequent injury to the back.  He thought that it was in error for the VA examiner to state that a crane operator experienced a lot of stress on the back based upon his previous experienced with Workers' Compensation claims.  He explained that the type of crane used was outfitted with air ride seats, like sitting in a recliner, and they were hand operated.  There was nothing strenuous about operating the crane.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's attorney further noted that the Veteran's claims file had been lost and rebuilt, and that many records were lost, including the Veteran's seeking initial VA treatment in 1981, the results of an examination at Lakeshore Hospital in Chicago, and a letter from Dr. G. providing a nexus to service.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran reported that, after attempting to obtain VA treatment for his back pain in 1981, he saw several spine surgeons from 1981 to 1992 who provided epidural injections.  He noted that these injections were referred to by Dr. S. in a 1993 report.  \r\n\r\nIn a June 2011 statement, Dr. S. wrote that at the time he saw the Veteran in 1992, he was a crane operator, and the job was causing him aggravation of his symptoms.  Prior to his evaluation, the Veteran had five back surgeries on his lower spine.  Clinical evaluation at that time was consistent with Grade I spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 with spinal stenosis and a herniated disc involving L4-L5.  He last saw the Veteran in November 1993.  To the extent that the Veteran was treated prior to 1992, the record did not exist at his office nor did he have access to it.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 2013 affidavit, the Veteran denied that his back was injury while operating cranes for a steel company after service; rather, his back was severely injured prior to starting this job.  He reported that his job included dropping a 5-ton ball onto waste steel ingots to break them into salvageable pieces.  The cranes he operated had fully hydraulic controls and air-ride seats.  \"Jolting\" as the VA examiner suggested was out of the question, and any such maneuvers would be unsafe and grounds for termination.  He performed none of the rigging of the cranes.  He expressed that the VA examiner did not ask him at any time about the cranes he operated or the work he was doing at the time.  \r\n\r\nIn a March 2015 statement, Dr. G. wrote that he was the Veteran's primary care physician from 1999 to 2007.  He was aware of the Veteran's chronic back problems since first seeing him in 1999.  He noted that he reviewed the Veteran's claims file, particularly the March 1979 report of fall.  He opined that the Veteran's back problems more likely than not started with the back injury suffered as a result of the traumatic fall.  In so finding, Dr. G. noted that the Veteran had fallen a significant distance and was paralyzed from the waist down at the time of the accident with negative Babinski response of the bilateral legs.  A few hours later he was then able to move his right toe and right knee, but still had no sensation above the L4-5 area.  He was released from care after 3 days and had suffered continuously ever since.  The Veteran also reported that he had a grapefruit-sized node on his lower spine in the same location as his current problems and a diagnostic code of 722.8 was assigned at the time of the spinal injury.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2015, the Veteran's claims file was reviewed by the previous 2010 VA examiner.  The examiner again opined that the claimed disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury or event.  In so finding the examiner noted that after the fall the Veteran was held for neurological observation, as the incident did involve drinking. He apparently recovered fully per notes in a few days. There was no mention on any physical bruising on the lower back or actual tenderness besides the numbness in the lower back. The lay evidence of apparent grapefruit sized lump on the applicant's low back could have been from resultant soft tissue contusion or muscular spasm. It could also have been a hematoma though much unlikely as this would have been noticed by the medical provider and subsequent skin changes that develops superficial to the contusion. However, as stated earlier, no evidence of bruising was noted in the medical notes.\r\n\r\nRegarding the lay evidence of continuous low back symptomology since service, the evidence did not quite bear out in the medical notes as there is absence of data for 2.5 years post service. Furthermore, if a significant trauma did occur that could have caused lumbar spine anatomical and physiological disruption such as disc rupture, spondylolisthesis which is translocation of one vertebra over another, or fracture of the spine, the recovery would not have been as insignificant or short term. It would have been almost impossible to function as a crane operator which he did for 11 years. Citing to medical studies, the examiner noted that current data showed that crane operators have a 3.6 times the probability of developing back pain compared to other industrial workers.\r\n\r\nAn April 2016 examination report from private physician Dr. R. notes that the Veteran, while in the course of his military service, fell down 4 flights of stairs while stationed at Fort Campbell. This fall down 4 flights of stairs was estimated to be 1:30 a.m.  He was rendered unconscious. He was transported via ambulance to Fort Campbell emergency room. He suffered injury to his head, neck and back, indicating paralysis and numbness of his low back and lower extremities. At the emergency room, his legs did not respond to painful stimuli.  X-rays were taken at Fort Campbell emergency room; however, these x-rays had not been made available.  He was subsequently sent by medevac to VAMC Nashville.  Reportedly, the VAMC Nashville records have been lost. According to the Veteran, the only reason the injury is documented is that the medevac records were \"wrapped around the C-File.\"  The Veteran was returned to Fort Campbell at approximately 7:00 a.m. and was admitted.  He recuperated over the next couple of days and was released on March 14th. He was prescribed crutches and Demerol which he utilized as directed.\r\n\r\nHe was instructed to follow up with the Nashville VA. However, the Veteran was subsequently transferred to Germany and was unable to follow up. In Germany he was unable to get treatment or medication. He suffered with significant lower back pain throughout this time period. He was in Germany for 1.5 years. He then got out of the service in 1981, and no exit examination performed.\r\n\r\nHe continued to suffer ongoing lower back pain following his discharge from the military. He failed conservative core strengthening treatment and interventional pain management injections. His lower back condition progressively deteriorated. Ultimately, the Veteran underwent lumbar spinal fusion in January 1993.\r\n\r\nFollowing the lumbar spinal fusion, the patient continued to experience significant lower back pain. Additional injections were performed. He stopped working in 2008 due to the lower back condition. \r\n\r\nDr. R. discussed the Veteran's service treatment records related to the fall, the November 1992 report from Dr. S. and lumbar x-rays and myelogram reports, operative report from January 1993 and post-surgical follow-up care, the November 1993 letter from Dr. G., SSA administrative decision reports, continued private treatment records, VA examination reports, and various documents from the Veteran's claims file.  Dr. R. also performed a physical examination, and noted current failed lumbar fusion surgery.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the etiology of this condition, Dr. R. noted that the emergency room report indicated the patient \"appears paralyzed from waist down\" and \"neither leg responds to painful stimuli.\" From a neurophysiological standpoint, these findings are more consistent with a localized lumbar injury, not a brain injury. If the paralysis was from a brain injury, there would need to be identifiable trauma to both signs of the brain, i.e., damage to the left side of the body can cause flaccid paralysis on the right side of the body and damage to the right side of the brain can cause flaccid paralysis on the left side of the body. Not only would the brain damage need to be on both sides of the head, but it would theoretically need to be in the same locations on both sides of the head.   Other clinical signs of an upper motor neuron disorder not present in this case included hyperreflexia, clonus, spasticity, pronator drift, and pathological reflexes.  \r\n\r\nDr. R. noted that Babinski's sign is a classic neurological test for corticospinal tract damage (upper motor neuron involvement).  In this test, the sole of the foot is stroked firmly with an instrument. This should elicit a normal plantar response as the toes curl inward. In patients with an upper motor neuron lesion, however, an abnormal extensor plantar response is elicited as the big toe extends upward and the remaining toes fan out. Babinski's sign is either present or absent, not positive or negative. In this case, there was no response with the Babinski maneuver initially, meaning the toes did not curl inward or outward. Later, at the emergency room, there was report that the right Babinski was negative and no response with left Babinski. These findings did not substantiate the presence of a Babinski sign and did not support the presence of an upper motor neuron lesion from-brain trauma.\r\nIn addition to the paralysis below the waist, there was also loss of sensation in the bilateral legs and the legs \"did not respond to painful stimuli.\" If these findings were related to brain injury, there would also need to be damage to the specific areas of the brain affecting the sensory cortex /sensory pathways to only the lower extremities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dr. R. found it is less likely than not that the bilateral lower extremity motor and sensory findings were related in any way to the traumatic brain injury.\r\n\r\nRather, Dr. R. found that the description of no sensation above the L4-5 area noted in treatment records was quite specific for the location of the sensory loss, and his return of motor function and sensation in the lower extremities was more likely than not related to a neuropraxia to the cauda equine.  He noted that trauma and involvement of the cauda equine or nerve roots below L1-L2 might result in lower motor neuron lesion.  Neuropraxia occurred in the peripheral nervous system when there is a temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of the nerve conduction.  He found the clinical findings of transient loss of sensation, transient loss of response to painful stimuli, and transient paralysis were more likely than not related to a lower motor neuron neuropraxia at the L4-L5 level.  Dr. R. also noted that large knot in the lumbar region following the fall would be consistent with blunt trauma to the lumbar region.  The issue was complicated by the fact that March 1979 x-rays were unavailable, but based on his review and interview with the Veteran and known neurophysiological findings in this case, it is more likely than not that the Veteran's lower extremity findings were related to localized lumbar injury and not to a brain injury.\r\n\r\nDr. R. noted the November 1992 findings of Dr. S.  While the Veteran had been previously treated by Dr. K., these records were not available for review.  He noted that the ligamentous laxity related by Dr. S. could be due to genetic or disease process, or from trauma.  He indicated that, with the absence of genetic predisposition of ligamentous laxity, any known disease process affecting the ligaments, the etiology of the L4-L5 instability (ligamentous laxity) is more likely than not related to a significant traumatic event. Based on his review of the submitted claims file and verbal history, this event was the March 1979 fall.  Dr. R. noted that the findings indicate the level of instability was at the L4-L5 level, which is exactly where the finding of loss of sensation was reported in March 1979.  \r\n\r\nHe concluded that the 1979 fall incident was more likely than not the only documented mechanism of injury that could have resulted in the instability at L4-L5, explained the clinical findings of lower extremity paralysis/sensory loss on that date, and correlates with the ultimate need for surgical fusion (1993).\r\n\r\nDr. R. discounted the 2010 and 2015 findings of the VA examiner, noting that the examiner's observations showed he only reviewed the record superficially.  First, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran was kept under observation as the incident involved drinking, but the records showed he was kept for neurologic observation for his head injury and lower extremity paralysis.  The VA examiner also did not discuss the actual presentation and clinical findings of paralysis and sensory loss.  He did not note that the file had been rebuilt and that there were missing records.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the VA examiner mistakenly indicated that the Veteran worked as a crane operator for 11 years, but he had this position for 3 years, and the patient's job duties involved jolting of the cabin, which it did not.  Moreover, he speculated that injury occurred during this position, but there was no report of industrial injury during this time frame.  \r\n\r\nIII.  Law and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nWith chronic disease shown as such in service (or within the presumptive period under \ufffd 3.307), so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b). To show a chronic disease in service, a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity is required, as is sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b). The Court has established that 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b), applies to only those chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a). See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1101. With respect to the current appeal, that list includes cardiovascular disease and organic diseases of the nervous system (including tinnitus). See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn addition, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including arthritis, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a), 3.309(a). However, in order for the presumption to apply, the evidence must indicate that the disability became manifest to a compensable (10 percent) degree within one year of separation from service.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran's service treatment record clearly document injury related to a fall.  While a back injury is not specifically documented, numbness and paralysis of the lower extremities is indicated.  In addition, the Veteran has reported that he was told that he had a grapefruit-sized lump in his low back, and he felt the lump after he regained sensation in his lower extremities.  As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report on that which he has personal knowledge.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).\r\n\r\nMoreover, it appears that some of the Veteran's service treatment records are unavailable or missing, as the Veteran at the very least was provided an x-ray of the lumbar spine, and x-rays reports have been unable to be located. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Appeals (Court) has held that in cases where records once in the hands of the government are lost, the Board has a heightened obligation to explain its findings and conclusions and to consider carefully the benefit-of-the-doubt rule where applicable.  See O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365, 367 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe record also clearly documents current back disability, diagnosed as degenerative joint disease, status post L4-L5-S1.  The question remains, however, whether the current disability is related to the in-service injury.  The Board notes that there are various competing opinions of record.  While the VA examiner opined that such a relationship is less like as not, various private examiners have linked the Veteran's current low back disability to service.\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the Board to assess the credibility and weight to be given the evidence.  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992)).  The probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board. See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993). \r\n\r\nWhen reviewing such medical opinions, the Board may appropriately favor the opinion of one competent medical authority over another.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).  However, the Board may not reject medical opinions based on its own medical judgment. See also Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30   (1993); Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).  In assessing medical opinions, the failure of the physician to provide a basis for his opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits. See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-49 (2000).  A medical opinion may not be discounted solely because the examiner did not review the claims file. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the majority of the private opinions associated with the claims file do not reflect review of the claims file and do not contain adequate rationale for the conclusions reached.  However, the opinion of the April 2016 private examiner, Dr. R., noted thorough review of the pertinent medical evidence of record, including the Veteran's service treatment records and relevant post-service findings.  Dr. R. also interviewed the Veteran and conducted a physical examination.  He provided substantial medical rationale that he indicated supported his finding that the Veteran's current disability as likely as not had its onset in service, related to trauma sustained by the fall.  \r\n\r\nWhile some of Dr. R.'s report is not substantiated in the claims file (such as the Veteran's report of use of crutches and 45 days of convalescent leave following the injury, and that the Veteran was not afforded an exit examination at discharge), it does not appear that such factors provided the basis for his opinion, and he provided a substantial amount of other medical rationale in reaching his determination.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner also had access to and reviewed the entire claims file.  He also provided an opinion with rationale for the conclusions reached.  However, the VA examiner also appeared to place significant weight on the Veteran's post-service employment as a crane operator.  He notes that the Veteran worked in this position for 11 years, while the record reflects approximately 3 years as a crane operator and 3 years as an expeditor which may have included some duties with a crane years in this position.  The examiner also did not appear to taken into the Veteran's account of his work duties, which he indicated did not involve much strain on his back or any workplace injury, and did not involve the type of crane work described by the examiner.\r\n\r\nThe Board there also observes that there are inconsistencies in the Veteran's reported post-service work duties as described in recent statements in compared to SSA filings.  Moreover, some treatment records dated in the 1990s suggest more recent onset of symptoms, perhaps occurring around June or July 1990.  However, he and the other lay witnesses have provided competent testimony regarding the chronic nature of the Veteran's symptoms since service, and various treatment records dated in 1993 reflect the Veteran's report of back problems since the in-service fall.  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board finds the evidence to be relative equipoise in showing that the Veteran has a low back disability, currently diagnosed as degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, status post L4-L5-S1 fusion, related to the documented in service fall and temporary paralysis. \r\n\r\nIn resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, status post L4-L5-S1 fusion is warranted.\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, status post L4-L5-S1, is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDAVID L.

The appellant \r\nwas provided adequate notice as to the evidence needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim.  The communications, such as a letter \r\nfrom the RO dated in April 2001 provided the appellant with \r\nan explanation of the type of evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate his claim, as well as an explanation of what \r\nevidence was to be provided by him and what evidence the VA \r\nwould attempt to obtain on his behalf.  See generally \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  The letter \r\nspecifically told the appellant that it was ultimately his \r\nresponsibility to submit all evidence.  This letter was \r\nprovided prior to adjudication of the claim.  The VA has no \r\noutstanding duty to inform the appellant that any additional \r\ninformation or evidence is needed.\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that because service connection is being \r\ndenied, any question as to the appropriate rating or \r\neffective date is moot, and there can be no failure-to-notify \r\nprejudice to the veteran with regard to those matters.  See \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, Nos. 01-1917 and 02-1506 (U.S. \r\nVet. App. Mar. 3, 2006).  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that all relevant facts have been \r\nproperly developed, and that all evidence necessary for \r\nequitable resolution of the issue on appeal has been \r\nobtained.  The record includes the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords.  The appellant has declined hearing.  He was \r\nafforded a VA examination.  For the foregoing reasons, the \r\nBoard concludes that all reasonable efforts were made by the \r\nVA to obtain evidence necessary to substantiate the \r\nappellant's claim.  Therefore, no further assistance to the \r\nappellant with the development of evidence is required.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability due to \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131.  The veteran contends that while \r\nin Korea, he was exposed to extremely cold temperatures and \r\nsuffered frostbite.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records, including the report \r\nof a medical examination conducted in October 1952 for the \r\npurpose of separation from service, are negative for any \r\nreferences to frostbite.   \r\n\r\nThe report of VA examination conducted in June 1959 is also \r\nnegative for references to frostbite.  The report of a VA \r\nexamination conducted in February 1960 shows that the veteran \r\nhad a history of sensations of pins and needles in both \r\nhands, but this was attributed to a cervical disc disorder.  \r\nThere was no mention of frostbite.  \r\n\r\nFinally, the report of a cold injury examination conducted by \r\nthe VA in July 2001 shows that the examiner noted that the \r\nveteran reported complaints of burning and tingling in his \r\nfeet along with numbness in the tips of his thumb and first \r\nfinger on the right hand.  The veteran stated that the \r\nproblems had been ongoing since he served in Korea and was \r\nexposed to temperatures of minus 35 degrees.  However, the \r\nexaminer noted that the veteran's medical history included \r\nhaving Type II diabetes for 8 years, and he also had a \r\nhistory of a cervical fusion after being hit in the head.  \r\nFollowing examination, the examiner stated that he could find \r\nno evidence at this time which would be consistent with cold \r\ntype injuries.  He noted that although it has been reported \r\nthat frostbite type injuries could predispose patients later \r\non to develop a polyneuropathy, this could be explained in \r\nthis case by the veteran's diabetic condition.  \r\n\r\nA service-connection claim must be accompanied by evidence \r\nwhich establishes that the claimant currently has the claimed \r\ndisability.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 \r\n(1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 (1992).  \r\nThe Board notes that lay persons, such as the veteran, are \r\nnot qualified to offer an opinion that requires medical \r\nknowledge, such as a diagnosis or an opinion as to the cause \r\nof a disability.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, \r\n494-5 (1992).  The VA examiner's opinion of record weighs \r\nagainst the veteran's claim, and is the only fully informed \r\nmedical opinion which is of record.  Therefore, the Board \r\nfinds the veteran does not currently have residuals of \r\nfrostbite of the feet and right hand.  Accordingly, the Board \r\nconcludes that residuals of frostbite of the feet and right \r\nhand were not incurred in or aggravated by service.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for residuals of frostbite of the feet and \r\nright hand is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJOAQUIN AGUAYO-PERELES\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n Department of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "60b606cbf8611168dd279cd1", "name": "0617470.txt", "plainText": "Citation Nr: 0617470\t\r\nDecision Date: 06/15/06    Archive Date: 06/27/06\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  03-29 862\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) \r\nin Roanoke, Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for claimed bilateral \r\nhearing loss.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tThe American Legion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nS. Layton, Law Clerk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from December 1958 to \r\nDecember 1960.  \r\n\r\nThis case came to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on \r\nappeal from a May 2003 decision of the RO.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All evidence and information necessary for an equitable \r\ndisposition of the appeal has been obtained.  \r\n\r\n2.  The veteran did not manifest hearing problems in service \r\nor for many years thereafter.  \r\n\r\n3.  The veteran's currently demonstrated bilateral hearing \r\nloss disability is not shown to be due to noise exposure or \r\nother event or incident during his period of active service.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran is not shown to have a disability manifested by a \r\nhearing loss due to disease or injury that was incurred in or \r\naggravated by service; nor may a sensorineural hearing loss \r\nbe presumed to have been incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n1110, 1131, 5107, 7104 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005).  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2005).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nDuties to notify and assist\r\n\r\nWith respect to the veteran's claims, VA has met all \r\nstatutory and regulatory notice and duty to assist \r\nprovisions.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326. \r\n\r\nPrior to initial adjudication of the veteran's claim, letters \r\ndated in December 2002, January 2003, April 2003, and May \r\n2003 fully satisfied the duty to notify \r\nprovisions.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1); \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was aware that it was ultimately his \r\nresponsibility to give VA any evidence pertaining to the \r\nclaims.  The 2002 and 2003 letters informed him that \r\nadditional information or evidence was needed to support his \r\nclaims and asked him to send the information or evidence to \r\nVA.  See Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 \r\n(2004) (Pelegrini II).  \r\n\r\nSince the Board has concluded that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claims for service connection, any \r\nquestions as to the appropriate disability rating or \r\neffective date to be assigned are rendered moot, and no \r\nfurther notice is needed.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \r\nApp. 473 (2006).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records, VA medical treatment \r\nrecords, and identified private medical records have been \r\nobtained to the extent available.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A; \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159.  \r\n\r\nThere is no indication in the record that any additional \r\nevidence, relevant to the issues decided herein, is available \r\nand not part of the claims folder.  The veteran was also \r\naccorded a VA examination in November 2002.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(c)(4).  \r\n\r\nDue to the completeness of the record and the 2002 VA \r\nexamination, the Board finds that no useful purpose would be \r\nserved in undertaking more development. \r\n\r\nSuch a remand would result in unnecessarily imposing further \r\nburdens on VA with no additional benefit flowing to the \r\nveteran. Similarly, as the veteran has indicated in a \r\nDecember 2005 letter that there is no other obtainable \r\nevidence, further development by the Board would serve no \r\nuseful purpose.  \r\n\r\nAs there is no indication that any failure on the part of VA \r\nto provide additional notice or assistance reasonably affects \r\nthe outcome of this case, the Board finds that any such \r\ndefect is harmless.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, No. 05-7157 (Fed. Cir. \r\nApr. 5, 2006).  \r\n\r\n\r\nService connection\r\n\r\nIn general, applicable laws and regulations state that \r\nservice connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.303.  \r\n\r\nThat a condition or injury occurred in service alone is not \r\nenough; there must be disability resulting from that \r\ncondition or injury.  See Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. \r\n141, 143 (1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 \r\n(1992).  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disease first \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for chronic \r\ndisabilities, such as sensorineural hearing loss, if such is \r\nshown to have been manifested to a compensable degree within \r\none year after the veteran was separated from service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2002 & Supp. 2005); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309 (2005).  \r\n\r\nThat an injury occurred in service alone is not enough; there \r\nmust be chronic disability resulting from that injury.  If \r\nthere is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during \r\nservice, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after \r\nservice is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nService connection for impaired hearing shall only be \r\nestablished when hearing status as determined by audiometric \r\ntesting meets specified pure tone and speech recognition \r\ncriteria.  Audiometric testing measures threshold hearing \r\nlevels (in decibels) over a range of frequencies (in Hertz).  \r\nHensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 158 (1993).  \r\n\r\nThe determination of whether a veteran has a disability based \r\non hearing loss is governed by 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385.  For the \r\npurposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired \r\nhearing will be considered to be a disability when the \r\nauditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, \r\n3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the \r\nauditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies \r\n500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or \r\ngreater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland \r\nCNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385.  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given the claimant.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 \r\n(1990); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.3.  \r\n\r\nWhen the positive and negative evidence as to a veteran's \r\nclaim are in approximate balance, thereby creating a \r\nreasonable doubt as to the merits of a claim, the veteran \r\nprevails.  Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  \r\n\r\nIf the Board determines that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claim, it has necessarily found that \r\nthe evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit \r\nof the doubt rule is inapplicable.  Id. at 1365.   \r\n\r\n\r\nHearing loss\r\n\r\nThe veteran is seeking service connection for hearing loss.  \r\nHe asserts that his hearing disability developed as a result \r\nof exposure to noise connected to machine gun fire, cannon \r\nfire, howitzer fire and engine noise in an armored personnel \r\ncarrier.  The veteran's DD Form 214 reflects that the \r\nveteran's military specialty was light weapons infantry.  \r\n\r\nIn an October 2003 statement, the veteran states that his \r\nservice job exposed him to live fire exercises without the \r\nbenefit of hearing protection.  The veteran also claimed that \r\ndue to these exercises, ringing and roaring noises stayed in \r\nhis ears \"forever, after.\"\r\n\r\nA careful review of the veteran's service medical records \r\nshows that they are negative for any complaints or findings \r\nof hearing loss.  In fact, the reports of medical examination \r\nfrom induction in 1958 and separation in 1960 reflect hearing \r\nthat was 15/15 or within normal limits.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran declared in his separation physical report that \r\nhis present health was \"good,\" and he checked that he had \r\nno ear trouble.  \r\n\r\nFollowing service in 1982, the veteran was hit by a vehicle.  \r\nThe letters from private physicians in July 1984 and April \r\n1988 stated that the veteran's hearing deteriorated after his \r\naccident.  \r\n\r\nOne of the doctors noted in his July 1984 letter that, while \r\nhe could not determine the cause of the veteran's hearing \r\nloss, the hearing loss began two years previously.   Another \r\ndoctor noted during a May 1984 examination that the veteran \r\nhad nerve damage in the accident and had \"lost his hearing \r\nsince then.\"   \r\n\r\nOn a private audiological evaluation in April 1988, pure tone \r\nthresholds, in decibels, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\nRIGHT\r\n62\r\n62\r\n65\r\n70\r\n75\r\nLEFT\r\n62\r\n55\r\n65\r\n70\r\n75\r\n\r\nSpeech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 74 \r\npercent in the right ear and of 72 percent in the left ear.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed the veteran's VA medical records from \r\n2002 to the present.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran was evaluated for hearing aids by a VA examiner \r\nin November 2002.  The consultation notes reveal that the \r\nveteran generally had severe hearing loss through 4000 Hertz \r\nwith word recognition scores of 32 percent in the right ear \r\nand of 36 percent in the left ear.  \r\n\r\nThe consultation notes from 2002 also state that the veteran \r\nclaimed that his hearing loss began twenty years previously.  \r\nThe examiner stated that the veteran's history \"[was] \r\npositive for occupational and military noise exposure.\"  The \r\nVA issued the veteran hearing aids.  There are no further \r\nrecords of VA treatment for hearing impairment.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran may presently sincerely believe that he \r\nincurred his hearing loss as a result of being exposed to \r\nvarious gun fire and engine noise, he is not considered \r\nqualified to render medical opinions regarding diagnoses or \r\nthe etiology of medical disorders, and his opinion is \r\nentitled to no weight or probative value.  See Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992); Moray v. Brown, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. 211 (1993).\r\n\r\nThe veteran has provided five lay statements stating that he \r\nhad hearing problems immediately upon his discharge, but none \r\nof them is supported by medical evidence or by the other \r\nevidence in the record.  See Espiritu supra.  \r\n\r\nIn fact, the medical evidence on file clearly shows the onset \r\nof hearing complaints and actual findings of impaired \r\nauditory acuity at a time many years after service.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the competent evidence demonstrates a current \r\nhearing disability for VA compensation purposes, the \r\npreponderance of the evidence does not establish the presence \r\nof a hearing loss until after the veteran's 1982 accident.  \r\n\r\nThe provided medical records do not establish a nexus linking \r\nthe current hearing disability to any event or incident of \r\nthe veteran's period of active service.  The competent \r\nevidence clearly establishes the onset of the claimed \r\nbilateral hearing disability to a time remote from this \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, as the preponderance of the evidence is against \r\nthe claim, service connection is not warranted.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a bilateral hearing loss is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nSTEPHEN L.

Hachey, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from July 7, 1966 to July \r\n29, 1966.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the \r\nBoard) on appeal from a May 2003 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in \r\nProvidence, Rhode Island (the RO).\r\n\r\nThe veteran presented testimony before the undersigned \r\nVeterans Law Judge at the RO in April 2006.  A transcript of \r\nthis hearing has been associated with the veteran's VA claims \r\nfolder.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe competent medical evidence of record does not demonstrate \r\nthe existence of a current back disability.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for a back disability is not warranted.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe veteran is seeking service connection for a back \r\ndisability.  He essentially maintains that he suffered a pre-\r\nservice thoracic spine fracture which was aggravated by his \r\nbrief period of active duty.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of clarity, the Board will review the \r\napplicable law and regulations, briefly describe the factual \r\nbackground of this case, and then proceed to analyze the \r\nclaim and render a decision.\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the provisions of the \r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  The VCAA \r\nincludes an enhanced duty on the part of VA to notify a \r\nclaimant as to the information and evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate a claim for VA benefits.  The VCAA also \r\nredefines the obligations of VA with respect to its statutory \r\nduty to assist claimants in the development of their claims.  \r\n\r\nThe VCAA alters the legal landscape in three distinct ways: \r\nstandard of review, notice and duty to assist.  The Board \r\nwill now address these concepts within the context of the \r\ncircumstances presented in this case.  \r\n\r\nStandard of review\r\n\r\nAfter the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's \r\nresponsibility to evaluate the entire record.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n7104(a) (West 2002).  When there is an approximate balance of \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2005) \r\n[reasonable doubt to be resolved in veteran's favor].  \r\n\r\nIn Gilbert v.

App. 49, 53 (1990), the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \r\nCourt) stated that \"a veteran need only demonstrate that \r\nthere is an 'approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence' in order to prevail.\"  To deny a claim on its \r\nmerits, the preponderance of the evidence must be against the \r\nclaim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), citing \r\nGilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.\r\n\r\nNotice\r\n\r\nThe VCAA requires VA to notify the claimant and the \r\nclaimant's representative, if any, of any information and any \r\nmedical or lay evidence not previously provided to VA that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, \r\nVA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's \r\nrepresentative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the \r\nevidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if \r\nany, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 (West 2002); see also Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) [a letter from VA to an \r\nappellant describing evidence potentially helpful to the \r\nappellant but not mentioning who is responsible for obtaining \r\nsuch evidence did not meet the standard erected by the VCAA].\r\n\r\nTo comply with the aforementioned VCAA requirements, the RO \r\nmust satisfy the following four requirements.  \r\n\r\nFirst, the RO must inform the claimant of the information and \r\nevidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate the \r\nclaim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(b)(1) (2005).  The Board observes that letters were \r\nsent to the veteran in March 2003 and April 2004 which were \r\nspecifically intended to address the requirements of the \r\nVCAA.  The March 2003 letter from the RO specifically \r\nnotified the veteran that to support a claim for service \r\nconnection, the evidence must show an \"injury in military \r\nservice or a disease that began in or was made worse during \r\nmilitary service, OR an event in service causing injury or \r\ndisease;\" a \"current physical or mental disability;\" and a \r\n\"relationship between your current disability and an injury, \r\ndisease, or event in service\" (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\nSecond, the RO must inform the claimant of the information \r\nand evidence VA will seek to provide.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 \r\n(West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1) (2005).  In the April \r\n2004 VCAA letter, the veteran was informed that VA was \r\nresponsible for obtaining \"[r]elevant records from any \r\nFederal agency\" including \"medical records from the \r\nmilitary, from VA hospitals (including private facilities \r\nwhere VA authorized treatment), or from the Social Security \r\nAdministration.\"  He was further advised that VA would make \r\n\"reasonable efforts\" to obtain \"[r]elevant records not \r\nheld by any Federal agency\" including records from \r\n\"State or local governments, private doctors and hospitals, \r\nor current or former employers.\"  \r\n\r\nThird, the RO must inform the claimant of the information and \r\nevidence the claimant is expected to provide.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1) (2005).  \r\nThe April 2004 letter notified the veteran that he \"must \r\ngive us enough information about your records so that we can \r\nrequest them from the person or agency that has them . . . \r\n[i]t's your responsibility to make sure that we receive all \r\nrequested records that aren't in the possession of a Federal \r\ndepartment or agency\" (emphasis in original).  More \r\nspecifically, the March 2003 letter instructed the veteran to \r\n\"[c]omplete, sign and return the enclosed VA Form 21-4142, \r\nAuthorization and Consent to Release Information to [VA] . . \r\n. [u]se a separate form for each doctor or hospital where you \r\nwere treated\" (emphasis in original).  The same letter asked \r\nthe veteran to provide \"the name of the person, agency, or \r\ncompany who has records that you think will help us decide \r\nyour claim;\" \"the address of this person, agency, or \r\ncompany;\" \"the approximate time frame covered by the \r\nrecords;\" and \"the condition for which you were treated, in \r\nthe case of medical records\" (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\nFinally, the RO must request that the claimant provide any \r\nevidence in his possession pertaining to the claim.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1) (2005).  \r\nThe April 2004 letter included notice that \"[i]f there is \r\nany other evidence or information that you think will support \r\nyour claim, please let us know . . . [i]f the evidence is in \r\nyour possession, please sent it to us.\"  This request \r\nsubstantially complies with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159 (b) in that it informed the veteran that he could \r\nsubmit or identify evidence other than what was specifically \r\nrequested by the RO.\r\n\r\nIn short, the record indicates that the veteran received \r\nappropriate notice under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103 and Quartuccio.\r\n\r\nReview of the record reveals that the veteran was not \r\nprovided notice of the VCAA prior to the initial adjudication \r\nof his claim, although partial VCAA notice was supplied by \r\nthe March 2003 VCAA letter discussed above.  The Board is of \r\ncourse aware of the Court's decision in Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), which appears to stand for \r\nthe proposition that VCAA notice must be sent prior to \r\nadjudication of an issue by the RO.  In the instant case, the \r\nveteran was provided with VCAA notice via the March 2003 and \r\nApril 2004 VCAA letters.  His claim was then readjudicated in \r\nthe July 2004 supplemental statement of the case, after he \r\nwas provided with the opportunity to submit evidence and \r\nargument in support of his claim and to respond to the VCAA \r\nnotice(s).  Thus, any VCAA notice deficiency has been \r\nrectified, and there is no prejudice to the veteran in \r\nproceeding to consider his claim on the merits.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Court recently held in Mayfield v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d \r\n1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006), that timing errors such as this do not \r\nhave the natural effect of producing prejudice and, \r\ntherefore, prejudice must be specifically pled.  In Mayfield, \r\nthe timing-of-notice error was found to be sufficiently \r\nremedied and cured by subsequent provision of notice by the \r\nRO, such that the appellant was provided with a meaningful \r\nopportunity to participate effectively in the processing of \r\nher claim by VA.  As discussed in the preceding paragraph, \r\nthe veteran received such notice and was given the \r\nopportunity to respond.  The veteran has pointed to no \r\nprejudice resulting from the timing of the VCAA notice. \r\n\r\nMoreover, because there is no indication that there exists \r\nany evidence which could be obtained which would have an \r\neffect on the outcome of this case, no further VCAA notice is \r\nnecessary.  See Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 \r\n(2001) [VCAA notice not required where there is no reasonable \r\npossibility that additional development will aid the \r\nveteran]. \r\n\r\nOne final comment regarding notice is in order.  In Dingess \r\nv. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), the Court observed \r\nthat a claim of entitlement to service connection consists of \r\nfive elements:  (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a \r\ndisability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service \r\nand the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) \r\neffective date.  Because a service connection claim is \r\ncomprised of five elements, the Court further held that the \r\nnotice requirements of section 5103(a) apply generally to all \r\nfive elements of that claim.  Therefore, upon receipt of an \r\napplication for service connection, section 5103(a) and \r\nsection 3.159(b) require VA to review the information and \r\nevidence presented with the claim and provide the claimant \r\nwith notice of what information and evidence not previously \r\nprovided, if any, will assist in substantiating the elements \r\nof the claim as reasonably contemplated by the application.  \r\nThis includes notice that a disability rating and an \r\neffective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if \r\nservice connection is awarded.\r\n\r\nIn this case, element (1), veteran status, is not at issue.  \r\nMoreover, elements (4) and (5), degree of disability and \r\neffective date, are rendered moot via the RO's (and the \r\nBoard's) denial of service connection.  In other words, any \r\nlack advisement as to those two elements is meaningless, \r\nbecause a disability rating and effective date are not, and \r\ncannot be, assigned in the absence of service connection.  \r\nThe RO recently sent the veteran a letter addressing the law \r\nand regulations regarding degree of disability and effective \r\ndate in any event.  The veteran's claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection is being denied by the Board based on \r\nelement (2), the existence of disability.  As explained \r\nabove, he has received proper VCAA notice as to his \r\nobligations, and those of VA, with respect to this crucial \r\nelement.  \r\n\r\nThus, there is no prejudice to the veteran in the Board's \r\nconsidering this case on its merits.  See Soyini v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) [strict adherence to \r\nrequirements in the law does not dictate an unquestioning, \r\nblind adherence in the face of overwhelming evidence in \r\nsupport of the result in a particular case; such adherence \r\nwould result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on \r\nVA with no benefit flowing to the veteran].\r\n\r\nBased on this procedural history, the Board finds that the \r\nveteran was notified properly of his statutory rights.\r\n\r\nDuty to assist\r\n\r\nIn general, the VCAA provides that VA shall make reasonable \r\nefforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary \r\nto substantiate a claim for VA benefits, unless no reasonable \r\npossibility exists that such assistance would aid in \r\nsubstantiating the claim.  The law provides that the \r\nassistance provided by VA shall include providing a medical \r\nexamination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an \r\nexamination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the \r\nclaim.  An examination is deemed \"necessary\" if the \r\nevidence of record (lay or medical) includes competent \r\nevidence that the claimant has a current disability, or \r\npersistent or recurrent symptoms of disability; and indicates \r\nthat the disability or symptoms may be associated with the \r\nclaimant's active military, naval, or air service; but does \r\nnot contain sufficient medical evidence for VA to make a \r\ndecision on the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2005).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that all relevant evidence necessary for an \r\nequitable resolution of the issue on appeal has been \r\nidentified and obtained, to the extent possible.  \r\nThe evidence of record includes the veteran's service medical \r\nrecords.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran and his representative have not identified any \r\noutstanding evidence which should potentially be obtained \r\nother than treatment records from Our Lady of Fatima Hospital \r\nin North Providence, Rhode Island for the period immediately \r\nfollowing service.  Although doubting that such records would \r\nstill exist after 40 years, the veteran indicated during his \r\nApril 2006 Board hearing that he would attempt to obtain \r\nthese records himself and forward them to VA.  See the April \r\n2006 hearing transcript, at 9-11.  The record was held open \r\nby the undersigned Veterans Law Judge for 30 days for that \r\npurpose.  The 30-day period has since expired, and medical \r\nrecords from Our Lady of Fatima Hospital (or any other \r\nhospital) have not been submitted.\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered remanding the case for VA to attempt \r\nto obtain the Our Lady of Fatima Hospital records.  However, \r\ngiven the veteran's apparent inability to obtain these \r\nrecords himself, the Board does not believe that VA would \r\nhave any more success.  The veteran and his representative \r\nindicated at the April 2006 hearing that such records were 40 \r\nyears old and that their existence was questionable.  The \r\nfact that such records were not submitted despite the \r\nveteran's attempts to obtain them leads the Board to conclude \r\nthat such records no longer exist.  Accordingly, remand of \r\nthe case to obtain these records would be unlikely to produce \r\nany additional evidence and would only serve to delay final \r\nadjudication of the veteran's claim.  Cf. Hayre v. West, 188 \r\nF.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 1999) [VA's efforts to obtain records \r\nshall continue until the records are obtained or unless it is \r\nreasonably certain that such records do not exist or that \r\nfurther efforts to obtain those records would be futile].  \r\n\r\nIn any event, as will be explained in greater detail below, \r\nthe claim is being denied based on the absence of evidence of \r\na current back disability.  Obtaining 40 year-old treatment \r\nrecords such as those identified by the veteran would not \r\nserve to fill this gap in the evidence.  The Board will \r\ntherefore proceed to adjudicate the claim with the evidence \r\ncurrently of record.\r\n\r\nThe Board has also given thought to whether a medical nexus \r\nopinion is necessary.  See generally Charles v. Principi, 16 \r\nVet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002).  However, as noted immediately \r\nabove, there is no indication in the record that a current \r\nback disability exists.  In the absence of evidence of a \r\ncurrent back disability, referral of this case for a nexus \r\nopinion would be futile.  The holding in Charles was clearly \r\npredicated on the existence of evidence of both in-service \r\nincurrence and a current diagnosis.  Evidence of a current \r\ndiagnosis is lacking.  Referral of this case for a nexus \r\nopinion under the circumstances here presented would \r\ntherefore be a useless act.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Board has carefully considered the provisions \r\nof the VCAA in light of the record on appeal, and for the \r\nreasons expressed above finds that the development of the \r\nclaim has been consistent with the provisions of the VCAA.  \r\n\r\nThe Board adds that general due process concerns have been \r\nsatisfied in connection with this appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.103 (2005).  The veteran engaged the services of a \r\nrepresentative, was provided with ample opportunity to submit \r\nevidence and argument in support of his claim, and presented \r\ntestimony before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at the RO \r\nin April 2006.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board will proceed to a decision on the \r\nmerits as to the issue on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPertinent Law and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection - in general\r\n\r\nIn general, service connection may be granted for disability \r\nor injury incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 \r\n(2005).  Service connection may also be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d) \r\n(2005).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for the claimed \r\ndisorder, there must be \r\n(1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or \r\nin certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service \r\nincurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) \r\nmedical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service \r\ndisease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  The determination as to \r\nwhether these requirements are met is based on an analysis of \r\nall the evidence of record and the evaluation of its \r\ncredibility and probative value.  See Baldwin v. West, 13 \r\nVet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\r\n\r\nService connection presupposes a current diagnosis of the \r\nclaimed disability.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. \r\n233, 225 (1992).  A \"current disability\" means a disability \r\nshown by competent medical evidence to exist at the time of \r\nthe award of service connection.  See Chelte v. Brown, 10 \r\nVet. App. 268 (1997).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nAs explained immediately above, service connection requires \r\nmedical evidence of a current disability.  See Hickson, \r\nsupra.\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, there is no medical evidence of record \r\nestablishing the existence of a current back disability.  \r\nIndeed, the only medical evidence in the case consists of the \r\nveteran's service medical records, which are now four decades \r\nold.  No medical evidence following service is included in \r\nthe record, and the veteran has neither submitted evidence of \r\na current back disability (including current treatment \r\nrecords) nor provided VA with authorization to obtain such \r\nrecords.  \r\n\r\nAlthough as discussed above the veteran has pointed to post-\r\nservice treatment at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, he has also \r\nindicated that the latest date of such treatment was in 1967.  \r\nSee VA Form 21-4142, dated in April 2006.  Even if such \r\nrecords did in fact exist (and as explained above, it appears \r\nthey do not) and in fact noted treatment for a back problem, \r\nthey would still be insufficient to demonstrate the existence \r\nof a current back disability.  Medical evidence of more \r\nrecent vintage would be required.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence in the claims file serving to establish the \r\nexistence of a current back disability is the veteran's own \r\nstatements.  It is now well settled, however, that laypersons \r\nwithout medical training, such as the veteran, are not \r\nqualified to render medical opinions regarding matters such \r\nas the existence of disability or determinations of etiology, \r\nwhich call for specialized medical knowledge.  See Espiritu \r\nv. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 (1992); see also 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.159 (2005) [competent medical evidence means evidence \r\nprovided by a person who is qualified through education, \r\ntraining, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, \r\nstatements, or opinions].  Although the veteran is free to \r\nreport his lay observation of symptoms, his statements \r\nregarding the existence of disability do not constitute \r\ncompetent medical evidence and are accordingly lacking in \r\nprobative value.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if the veteran may occasionally experience \r\nback pain, that does not serve to establish the existence of \r\nan identifiable back disability.  See Sanchez-Benitez v. \r\nWest, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999) [a symptom alone, without a \r\ndiagnosed or identifiable underlying malady or condition, \r\ndoes not in and of itself constitute a disability for which \r\nservice connection may be granted].\r\n\r\nIn short, the first Hickson element has not been satisfied, \r\nand the veteran's claim fails on that basis.  Throughout the \r\nthree plus years this claim has been pending, the veteran and \r\nhis representative have had every opportunity to either \r\nsubmit medical evidence of a current back disability or \r\nprovide VA with authorization to obtain the same.  The March \r\n2003 and April 2004 VCAA letters reiterated the importance of \r\nsuch evidence.  Despite these admonitions, however, no \r\nmedical evidence has been identified which would serve to \r\ndemonstrate the existence of a current back disability.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(a) (West 2002) [noting that \"a claimant \r\nhas the responsibility to present and support a claim for \r\nbenefits under the laws administered by the Secretary\"].  \r\nBecause evidence of a current disability is lacking, service \r\nconnection for a back disability is not warranted.  See \r\nBrammer, supra.\r\n\r\nIn summary, for reasons and bases expressed above, the Board \r\nfinds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nveteran's claim of entitlement to serviced connection for a \r\nlow back disability.  The benefit sought on appeal is \r\naccordingly denied.\r\n\r\nAdditional comment\r\n\r\nThe Board's discussion above should serve to inform the \r\nveteran of the kind of evidence which would substantiate his \r\nclaim.  The Board additionally observes that even if the \r\nveteran submits evidence of a current back disability, he \r\nwould do well to also obtain a medical opinion concerning \r\nwhether such current disability is related to his military \r\nservice, and in particular whether the pre-existing back \r\ndisorder was aggravated thereby. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a back disability is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nBarry F.

Acosta, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from March 1962 to February \r\n1966.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a September 2001 rating decision of \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Seattle, Washington, \r\nRegional Office (RO), which denied the veteran's petition to \r\nreopen a previously denied claim for service connection for \r\nparanoid schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nThe veteran provided testimony in support of his appeal at a \r\nhearing that was chaired by the undersigned sitting at the RO \r\nin April 2004.  A transcript of that hearing has been made \r\npart of the record.\r\n\r\nIn March 2005, the Board reopened the service connection \r\nclaim and remanded the case to the agency of original \r\njurisdiction (AOJ) for additional development and re-\r\nadjudication of the claim on the merits.  Having completed \r\nthe requested development, the AOJ has returned the case to \r\nthe Board for appellate disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe veteran's psychiatric disorder, currently diagnosed as \r\nparanoid schizophrenia, did not precede service, did not \r\noriginate in service, was first diagnosed more than 6 years \r\nafter the veteran's separation from active military service, \r\nand is not shown to be etiologically related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe veteran's psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or \r\naggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1111, 1112, \r\n1131, 1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, \r\n3.309 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Preliminary matters-The VCAA\r\n\r\nThe VCAA describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants \r\nin substantiating their claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. \r\n2005); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2005).\r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, when VA receives a complete or substantially \r\ncomplete application for benefits, it is required to notify \r\nthe claimant of any information and medical or lay evidence \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate his claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) (2005); \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).\r\n\r\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi (Pelegrini II), 18 Vet. App. 112, \r\n120-21 (2004), the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) held that VA must inform the claimant \r\nof any information and evidence not of record (1) that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to \r\nprovide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide; \r\nand (4) must request that the claimant provide any evidence \r\nin his possession that pertains to the claim.\r\n\r\nThe VCAA requires \"a deliberate act of notification directed \r\nto meeting the requirements of section 5103, not an \r\nassemblage of bits of information drawn from multiple \r\ncommunications issued for unrelated purposes.\"  Mayfield v. \r\nNicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed.Cir. 2006) (Mayfield II).\r\n\r\nVA fully complied with its Pelegrini II notification duties \r\nin this case by means of a letter issued in April 2005.  \r\nThus, the veteran has received adequate VCAA notice, as \r\ndescribed in Pelegrini.  See Short Bear v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \r\nApp. 341 (2005).\r\n\r\nThe Court has also held that that the VCAA notice \r\nrequirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection \r\nclaim.  Those five elements include:  1) veteran status; 2) \r\nexistence of a disability; (3) a connection between the \r\nveteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of \r\ndisability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nIn Dingess/Hartman, the Court further held that, upon receipt \r\nof an application for a service-connection claim, 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) require VA to give notice \r\nto the claimant of what information and evidence not \r\npreviously provided, if any, is necessary to substantiate the \r\nelements of the claim, as reasonably contemplated by the \r\napplication.  The notice must also inform a claimant that a \r\ndisability rating and an effective date for the award of \r\nbenefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  \r\nId.\r\n      \r\nIn the present appeal, the veteran was provided specific \r\nnotice of what type of information and evidence was needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim for service connection.  He was not \r\nprovided with notice of the type of evidence necessary to \r\nestablish an effective date for the claimed disability.  \r\nHowever, since the Board is denying in this decision the \r\nveteran's claim for service connection, no effective date is \r\nbeing assigned.  Thus, the veteran is not prejudiced by the \r\nlack of this element of notice and the Board can accordingly \r\nconduct appellate review of his claim.  See Bernard v. Brown, \r\n4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993) (where the Board addresses a \r\nquestion that has not been addressed by the AOJ, the Board \r\nmust consider whether the veteran has been prejudiced \r\nthereby).\r\n\r\nIn Pelegrini II, the Court also held that VCAA notice should \r\nbe given before an initial AOJ decision is issued on a claim.  \r\nPelegrini II, at 119-120.  There is no indication in the \r\nrecord, nor has the veteran alleged, that the timing \r\ndeficiency in this case resulted in any prejudice to him.  \r\nMoreover, any timing deficiency was cured by the re-\r\nadjudication of the claim by VA's Appeal Management Center in \r\nDecember 2005.  Mayfield II.\r\n\r\nThe VCAA also requires VA to make reasonable efforts to help \r\nevery claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate his \r\nclaim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.159(c), (d) (2005).  This \"duty to assist\" contemplates \r\nthat VA will help a claimant obtain records relevant to his \r\nclaim, whether or not the records are in Federal custody, and \r\nthat VA will provide a medical examination and/or opinion \r\nwhen necessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the duty to assist has been fulfilled, \r\nas VA has secured all identified records pertaining to the \r\nmatter on appeal and has had the veteran examined.  There is \r\nno suggestion on the current record that there remains \r\nevidence that is pertinent to the matter on appeal that has \r\nyet to be secured.  Thus, the appeal is ready to be \r\nconsidered on the merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Applicable legal criteria\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131.  Service \r\nconnection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed \r\nafter discharge when all of the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn order to prevail on the issue of service connection for \r\nany particular disability, there must be (1) medical evidence \r\nof a current disability; (2) medical evidence, or in certain \r\ncircumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence \r\nof a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the \r\ncurrent disability.  Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 \r\n(1999).  The determination as to whether these three \r\nrequirements are met is based on an analysis of all the \r\nevidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and \r\nprobative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, service connection for any type of psychosis is \r\npresumed if manifested to a compensable degree within one \r\nyear from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309.  VA considers \r\nschizophrenia, as well as delusional, psychotic, and \r\nschizoaffective disorders, types of psychotic disorders.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.130, the subtitle to Diagnostic Codes 9201-\r\n9211, which reads \"Schizophrenia and other psychotic \r\ndisorders.\"\r\n\r\nEvery veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition \r\nwhen examined, accepted and enrolled for service, except as \r\nto defects noted at the time of the examination, acceptance \r\nand enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence or \r\nmedical judgment is such as to warrant a finding that the \r\ndisease or injury existed before acceptance and enrollment, \r\nand was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1111.\r\n\r\nVA's General Counsel has held that, in order to rebut the \r\npresumption of sound condition under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1111, VA \r\nmust show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the \r\ndisease or injury existed prior to service, and that the \r\ndisease or injury was not aggravated by service.  VAOPGCPREC \r\n3-03 (July 16, 2003).  The United States Court of Appeals for \r\nthe Federal Circuit has adopted the General Counsel's \r\nposition.  Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2004).\r\n\r\nIII.  Evidence\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records reveal that he was \r\nfound to be psychiatrically normal on entrance examination in \r\nMarch 1962, at which time he denied ever having had, or \r\ncurrently having, frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or \r\nterrifying nightmares, depression or excessive worry, and \r\nnervous trouble of any sort.\r\n\r\nOn medical examination in October 1964 for \"remote \r\nassignment\" purposes, the veteran reported frequent trouble \r\nsleeping and depression or excessive worry, which the \r\nexaminer noted, referred to occasional episodes of \r\nsleeplessness, which were usually associated with his \r\nworrying about the future but which did not interfere with \r\nhis duties and involved no complications and had left no \r\nsequelae.  The psychiatric examination was again reported as \r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his separation examination in February 1966, \r\nthe veteran reported depression or excessive worry, but \r\ndenied frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying \r\nnightmares, and nervous trouble of any sort.  The examiner \r\nexplained the veteran's statement by indicating that he was \r\nreferring to depression associated with situational anxieties \r\nhe had had in 1961 (before service), with no recurrence or \r\nsequelae.  This same examiner found the veteran to be \r\npsychiatrically normal.\r\n\r\nThere is no competent evidence of any psychotic disorder, or \r\nany other type of psychiatric disorder, for that matter, to \r\nany degree within the one-year period immediately following \r\nthe veteran's separation from active military service.\r\n\r\nThe earliest evidence of record showing the manifestation of \r\na psychiatric disorder in this case was produced in August \r\n1972, over six years after the veteran's separation from \r\nactive military service.  Private medical records produced in \r\nthat date indicate that this was the veteran's first \r\npsychiatric referral following a violent incident with his \r\ngirlfriend for which he now was facing criminal charges.\r\n\r\nAn August 1972 admission summary shows that the veteran \r\nreported a traumatic childhood during which he had sustained \r\nsevere, overly punitive beatings from his mother, whose \r\nbehavior he described as irrational and whom he said he \r\nfeared was delusional.  The veteran reported having been \r\ndiagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.  He denied, however, any \r\nmental hospitalizations during his four years of active duty, \r\nindicating that his \"positive personality\" was strong \r\nenough to barely keep him out of trouble.  The examiner \r\nconfirmed that the veteran was suffering from \"a severe \r\nparanoid illness at this point\" and stated that it appeared \r\nthat he had been treated on an outpatient basis for paranoid \r\nschizophrenia a year ago.\r\n\r\nIn a statement dated in March 1974, the private psychiatrist \r\nwho subscribed the above report of August 1972 confirmed that \r\nthe veteran had been hospitalized in August 1972 for a \r\ncompetency evaluation and that he had remained admitted until \r\nNovember 1973.  The veteran had been found to be acutely \r\ndisturbed and grossly psychotic on admission in August 1972.  \r\nHe remained somewhat depressed at the time of discharge, but \r\ngrandiose and paranoid ideation had largely subsided.\r\n\r\nA VA medical record dated in April 1975 reflects a 40-day VA \r\npsychiatric admission for treatment of paranoid \r\nschizophrenia, while an August 1977 VA neuropsychiatric \r\nexamination report confirms the same diagnosis and reveals a \r\nhistory of social difficulties (essentially revolving around \r\nrepeated incidents of racial discrimination) as a child.  An \r\nOctober 2001 VA mental disorders examination report confirms \r\nthe diagnosis as well, and the Board notes that there are \r\nalso in the file additional VA and private medical records \r\nreflecting psychiatric treatment throughout the years, as \r\nrecently as in the year 2003, mostly for paranoid \r\nschizophrenia.\r\n\r\nOn VA mental disorders examination in June 2004, the examiner \r\nnoted that the veteran had been first described as having \r\npsychotic behavior in 1972, with a history of treatment a \r\nyear earlier.  The examiner accurately noted that the veteran \r\ndenied, when he had that treatment in 1972, any mental \r\ntreatment during service, and that he did not claim that his \r\nmental disorder had begun during service when examined by VA \r\nin February 1974, or when receiving hospital treatment \r\nbetween December 1973 and March 1974, and between February \r\n1975 to April 1975.  The examiner noted that the veteran had \r\nfirst made such claim in 1985, when he first filed his claim \r\nfor service connection for a psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nThe examiner, a board-certified psychiatrist, reported that \r\nhe had thoroughly reviewed the veteran's claims folder.  He \r\nnoted that the veteran had given a history of situational \r\nanxiety/depression prior to service, in 1961, and that he had \r\nreported occasional insomnia due to worry about the future \r\nwhile in service in October 1964, which was deemed as not \r\ninterfering with his duties.  He noted the veteran's report \r\nof having a \"positive personality\" that had kept him out of \r\ntrouble, as well as the veteran's years-long history of \r\ntreatment for a chronic psychotic condition, probably best \r\ndiagnosed as a shizoaffective disorder, but also \r\ncharacterized as schizophrenia.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner then offered this opinion:\r\n\r\nIt is at least as likely as not that the \r\ncurrently diagnosed schizoaffective \r\ndisorder is directly related to the \r\nreported anxiety depression in 1961 and \r\nthe insomnia reported in 1964.  There was \r\nnot enough longitudinal history of \r\nsymptomatology at the time of his \r\nmilitary evaluations to give him a \r\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia or \r\nschizoaffective disorder based on what \r\nwas available in the military medical \r\nrecord.  It is only in retrospect that \r\none can deduce that the earlier symptoms \r\nwere perhaps prodromal symptoms of his \r\ncurrent ongoing chronic mental illness.\r\n\r\nBecause the facts of this case clearly raise the question of \r\nwhether the currently diagnosed psychiatric disorder preceded \r\nservice and, if it did, whether there was aggravation of that \r\ndisorder during service, the Board remanded this case in \r\nMarch 2005 with instructions to the AOJ to ensure that all \r\navailable service records were secured and obtain an addendum \r\nto the above VA medical opinion, if possible by the same \r\npsychiatrist, and thereafter re-adjudicate the claim taking \r\ninto consideration the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1111 \r\nregarding aggravation.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ located additional service records, which were \r\nassociated with the veteran's claims folder.  Because the VA \r\npsychiatrist who examined the veteran in June 2004 was not \r\navailable, the veteran was re-examined by another VA \r\npsychiatrist in November 2005.  This psychiatrist then \r\nsubmitted a comprehensive five-page examination report, \r\nanswering the specific questions posed by the Board in its \r\nremand of March 2005.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the examiner noted the fact that the veteran \r\nwas never diagnosed with a psychosis during service, but \r\nlater, in the 1970's, for which reason his claim had remained \r\ndenied.  He then stated that a VA psychiatrist had suggested, \r\nin June 2004, \"in rather tentative terms, the possibility \r\nthat some symptoms mentioned in [the veteran's] military \r\nrecords might have represented a prodrome of a schizophrenic \r\nillness, on an 'as likely as not' basis,\" even though that \r\npsychiatrist had acknowledged that there was not enough data \r\nin the veteran's military record to justify a diagnosis of \r\nschizophrenia at the time.  The current examiner noted that \r\nthe prior psychiatrist had used \"very tentative language \r\nsuch as 'perhaps'\" and had given \"no firm impression.\"\r\n\r\nThe examiner stated that he was board-certified as well, with \r\n\"long experience\" [in psychiatry].  He also stated that he \r\nhad reviewed the veteran's entire claims folder, to include \r\nhis original service medical records, as well as a packet of \r\nmore recently received military records, mostly in the nature \r\nof personnel files, which, in his opinion, \"turn out to be \r\nhighly relevant to the current issue and will be discussed at \r\nsome length below.\"\r\n\r\nThe examiner pointed out that the two above-referenced \r\ninservice entries of 1964 and 1966 had \"occasioned a good \r\ndeal of speculation,\" and that \"[i]t was from these data \r\nthat the opinion was rendered in [June] 2004 about a possible \r\nprodrome to schizophrenia, in the absence of any other \r\nmedical or psychiatric evidence.\"  He also noted that he \r\nasked the veteran at length about his difficulties during his \r\ndevelopmental period (prior to service), which the veteran \r\nreported as being related to factors such as his being of \r\nmulti-racial origin, his being fearful of competition, and \r\nhis \"great difficulty\" with his parents whose ultimatum led \r\nto his joining the military at the age of 17.\r\n\r\nThe examiner stressed the fact that the veteran had showed no \r\npsychiatric symptoms upon induction examination in 1962 and \r\nthat the veteran's personnel file revealed that the veteran \r\n\"did well in his training as an electrical generation \r\nspecialist and made continuing progress at a base in Kansas \r\non into his extended tour in Alaska.\"  He also noted that \r\nthe veteran suffered a brain concussion while stationed in \r\nAlaska, but that he apparently had recovered from this \r\nconcussion without sequelae.\r\n\r\nThe examiner further noted that the veteran's performance \r\nratings in Alaska were \"remarkably good,\" that he had \r\nscored near the top of available performance ratings, and \r\nthat the veteran's supervisors at that time had stated that \r\nthe veteran showed \"aggressive enthusiasm\" in his work and \r\nbecoming a trainer of others.  He was rated as \r\n\"exceptionally well qualified\" in 1966 and was found to be \r\nable to utilize on-the-job training quite well.  The examiner \r\nconcluded that \"there is no evidence of any mental disorder \r\ninterfering with this man's function [during service], and \r\nindeed his final performance rating placed him almost in the \r\ntop 10% of all airmen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of this examination, the veteran showed no signs \r\nof an organic cognitive impairment or an active psychotic \r\ncondition.  He was apparently complying with his medication \r\nregimen and treatment program and reported plans to continue \r\nto do so.  The examiner gave an Axis I diagnosis of a \r\nschizoaffective disorder, chronic and severe, but currently \r\ncontrolled on continuous medication and with participation in \r\nheavily supervised maintenance program.  He then opined that, \r\neven though the veteran had had a situational crisis \r\ninvolving school truancy prior to service, \"[n]othing in the \r\navailable data today indicates that [the veteran] was \r\npsychotic or even close to such a state prior to \r\nenlistment,\" no symptoms of psychosis or any major \r\ndiagnosable psychiatric condition were noted during service, \r\nand, in fact, personnel records \"indicate very good \r\nfunctioning.\"\r\n\r\nThe examiner further opined that, \"[t]hus, there is no \r\nevidence of a pre-existing psychiatric disorder or of defined \r\naggravation of one in military service, let alone the onset \r\nof one.\"\r\n\r\nThe examiner then went on to state that the veteran's major \r\npsychiatric condition became manifested several years after \r\nservice, becoming \"quite flagrant, involving episodes of \r\nmajor violence, repeated hospitalizations, and the like,\" \r\nwhich he characterized as representing \"a very complex and \r\ndifficult psychiatric history.\"  The examiner once again \r\nstressed out the fact that the veteran's personnel \r\nperformance records revealed \"a very high level of \r\nperformance in the Air Force,\" which in his opinion would be \r\n\"incompatible with the onset of a major psychotic condition \r\nor even a 'prodromal' of one.\"  The examiner concluded that:\r\n\r\nOn careful review of the evidence \r\navailable, and of the very tentative \r\nlanguage used by the reviewer in 2004, it \r\ncannot be concluded that either an active \r\npsychosis or the prodrome of one existed \r\nbefore or during military service or that \r\nany such condition was aggravated by \r\nmilitary service.  In fact, to do so, in \r\nthe absence of more specific \r\nsymptomatology, would verge upon \r\npsychiatric conjecture.  The Court ... has \r\nspecifically opined that \"psychiatric \r\nconjecture has no evidentiary value.\"\r\n\r\nIV.  Legal analysis\r\n\r\nBecause a psychiatric disorder was not specifically noted \r\nupon medical examination when the veteran was accepted for \r\nservice, the veteran is accorded the presumption of soundness \r\nat entrance to active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1111.\r\n\r\nAlthough medical professionals noted the veteran's report of \r\npsychiatric difficulties prior to service, as a lay person, \r\nthe veteran would not be competent to report this diagnosis.  \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  (The \r\nveteran's reports are not transformed into competent evidence \r\nby virtue of being recorded by medical professionals, and \r\ncannot serve to rebut the presumption of soundness.  Miller \r\nv. West, 11 Vet. App. 345 (1998).)\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the VA medical opinion rendered in November \r\n2005 confirms the fact that a psychiatric disorder was never \r\nshown to be manifested prior to service.  Thus, in the \r\npresent case there is no clear and unmistakable evidence that \r\na psychiatric disorder existed prior to service.\r\n\r\nInsofar as the Board has determined that there is no clear \r\nand unmistakable evidence that a psychiatric disorder existed \r\nprior to service, there is no need to further address the \r\nquestion of whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence \r\nthat a pre-service condition increased in severity during \r\nservice.  The presumption of soundness has not been rebutted \r\nand the Board now only needs to determine whether the \r\npreponderance of the evidence shows that the current \r\npsychiatric disorder was incurred in service.  Wagner v. \r\nPrincipi, 370 F. 3d 1089 (Fed.Cir.2004).\r\n\r\nThe question of whether the evidence shows that the current \r\npsychiatric disorder was incurred in service has been \r\naddressed in this case by the veteran himself (to include at \r\nhis April 2004 hearing) and by the VA psychiatrists who \r\nexamined him in June 2004 and November 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges the veteran's testimony indicating his \r\nstrong belief that his current psychiatric disorder is \r\netiologically related to service.  He is certainly competent \r\nto report his symptoms.  However, as a lay person without \r\nmedical training and expertise, he is not considered \r\ncompetent to render a probative opinion on a medical matter \r\nrelated to the field of mental health.  Bostain v. West, 11 \r\nVet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 \r\nVet. App. 492 (1992); see also  Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. \r\n183, 186 (1997) (a layman is generally not capable of opining \r\non matters requiring medical knowledge).  Thus, the Board \r\ncannot assign any probative value to his opinions as to \r\ncausation. \r\n\r\nIn regards to the VA mental disorders examination reports of \r\nJune 2004 and November 2005, the Board has determined to \r\nassign more probative value to the latter report, as it was \r\nrendered after a review of the record once the record had \r\nbeen completed (with the veteran's personnel file, which was \r\nnot available to the June 2004 examiner), and considered the \r\nJune 2004 report.\r\n\r\nThe Board has assigned lesser probative value to the June \r\n2004 opinion, not only because its subscriber did not have \r\nthe benefit of reviewing the veteran's personnel records, but \r\nbecause the November 2005 examiner found the earlier report \r\nto be the product of conjecture, the examiner having \r\n\"deduced,\" due to the limited evidence of inservice \r\npsychiatric symptoms, that it was at least as likely as not \r\nthat the few symptoms reported during service represented \r\n\"perhaps prodromal symptoms\" of the currently manifested \r\npsychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rationale offered by the November 2005 \r\nVA examiner evidences a very comprehensive review by that \r\npsychiatrist of all the evidence of record and reasoning \r\nbased on what the record actually shows, rather than on mere \r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nBecause the most probative opinions are against the veteran's \r\nclaim, the preponderance of the evidence is against a grant \r\nof service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  As the \r\nevidence is not evenly balanced, the benefit of the doubt \r\nrule is not applicable, and the claim is denied.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board notes that, because the veteran's \r\npsychotic disorder (schizophrenia, or schizoaffective \r\ndisorder, see 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.130) was first diagnosed more \r\nthan six years after his discharge from active duty, and \r\nthere were no reports of psychotic symptomatology during the \r\nfirst year after separation from service, the evidence is \r\nagainst the grant of presumptive service connection under \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307 and 3.309.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a psychiatric disorder, claimed as \r\nparanoid schizophrenia, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMark D.

Grabia, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from \r\nAugust 1967 to August 1970.  He had service in the Republic \r\nof Vietnam from February 1968 to February 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a January 2004 rating decision by the Reno, \r\nNevada, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA), which denied the benefits sought on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe veteran presented testimony at a Travel Board hearing \r\nchaired by the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge in May \r\n2005. A transcript of the hearing is associated with the \r\nveteran's claims folders.\r\n\r\nThe veteran is pursuing a claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection for pseudofolliculitis.  This issue has not been \r\ndeveloped for appellate consideration, and is referred to the \r\nRO.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.\tThe veteran has a current medical diagnosis of PTSD.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe veteran's claimed in-service stressor is related \r\nto claimed participation in combat.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe objective evidence of record preponderates \r\nagainst a finding that the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe occurrence of the veteran's claimed in-service \r\nstressful event is not supported by credible \r\ncorroborating evidence.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe current diagnosis of PTSD is based upon \r\nunsubstantiated reports of a stressor, or stressors, \r\nas provided by the veteran.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nPTSD was not incurred in or aggravated by active military \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5102 VA first has a duty to provide an \r\nappropriate claim form, instructions for completing it, and \r\nnotice of information necessary to complete the claim if it \r\nis incomplete.  Second, under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a), VA has a \r\nduty to notify the claimant of the information and evidence \r\nneeded to substantiate and complete a claim, i.e., evidence \r\nof veteran status; existence of a current disability; \r\nevidence of a nexus between service and the disability; the \r\ndegree of disability, and the effective date of any \r\ndisability benefits.  The veteran must also be notified to \r\nsubmit all evidence in his possession, what specific evidence \r\nhe is to provide, and what evidence VA will attempt to \r\nobtain.  VA thirdly has a duty to assist claimants in \r\nobtaining evidence needed to substantiate a claim.  This \r\nincludes obtaining all relevant evidence adequately \r\nidentified in the record, and in some cases, affording VA \r\nexaminations.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A. \r\n\r\nIn this case, there is no issue as to providing an \r\nappropriate application form or completeness of the \r\napplication.  Written notice provided in November 2003 and \r\nDecember 2004 correspondence fulfills the provisions of 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) save for a failure to provide notice of \r\nthe type of evidence necessary to establish a disability \r\nrating or effective date for the disability on appeal.  The \r\nclaim was readjudicated in a May 2005 supplemental statement \r\nof the case.  The failure to provide notice of the type of \r\nevidence necessary to establish a disability rating and an \r\neffective date for the disability on appeal is harmless \r\nbecause the Board has determined that the preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the claim for service connection.  \r\nHence, any questions regarding what rating or effective date \r\nwould be assigned are moot.  See e.g., Dingess v. Hartman, 19 \r\nVet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nFinally, VA has secured all available pertinent evidence and \r\nconducted all appropriate development.  The service medical \r\nrecords are available, as well as VA treatment records, and \r\nthere is no pertinent evidence which is not currently part of \r\nthe claims file.  As well, the veteran testified during a \r\nhearing before the undersigned in May 2005.  Hence, VA has \r\nfulfilled its duty to assist the appellant in the prosecution \r\nof his claim. \r\n\r\nII. Legal Analysis\r\n\r\nA. Pertinent Law\r\n\r\nApplicable law provides that service connection will be \r\ngranted if it is shown that the veteran suffers from \r\ndisability resulting from an injury suffered or disease \r\ncontracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a \r\npreexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of \r\nduty, in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  That an injury occurred in service alone is \r\nnot enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from \r\nthat injury.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic \r\ncondition during service, then a showing of continuity of \r\nsymptomatology after service is required to support a finding \r\nof chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nFor PTSD claims, service connection requires medical evidence \r\nestablishing a diagnosis of the condition, credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor \r\nactually occurred, and a link, established by medical \r\nevidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed in- \r\nservice stressor.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f). If it is determined \r\nthat a veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, or \r\nthe claimed stressor is not related to combat; the veteran's \r\nlay testimony alone will not be enough to establish the \r\noccurrence of the alleged stressor.  In such cases, the \r\nrecord must contain service records or other corroborative \r\nevidence which substantiates or verifies the veteran's \r\ntestimony or statements as to the occurrence of the claimed \r\nstressors.  See Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second criterion, the evidence necessary \r\nto establish that the claimed stressor actually occurred \r\nvaries depending on whether the veteran \"engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\"  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b) (West 2002).  \"Where \r\nit is determined, through recognized military citations or \r\nother supportive evidence, that the veteran was engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressors are related \r\nto such combat, the veteran's lay testimony regarding claimed \r\nstressors must be accepted as conclusive as to their actual \r\noccurrence and no further development for corroborative \r\nevidence will be required, provided that the veteran's \r\ntestimony is found to be 'satisfactory,' e.g., credible, and \r\n'consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof [combat] service.\"'  Zarycki, 6 Vet. App. at 91, 98; 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(d), (f). \r\n\r\nB. Factual Background\r\n\r\nService medical records reveal that the veteran was seen once \r\nin October 1968 and treated for tiredness, nervousness, \r\ninability to sleep, and weight loss.  While the initial \r\nimpression was anxiety; he was treated for possible stomach \r\nparasites.  Service medical records are negative for \r\ncomplaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder \r\nto include PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's October 1966 induction examination and his June \r\n1970 separation examination reveal normal psychiatric \r\nevaluations.  The veteran's Report of Discharge or Transfer \r\n(DD Form 214) and service personnel records show that he was \r\na preventive medicine specialist and served in Vietnam from \r\nFebruary 1968 to February 1969.  His decorations and awards \r\ninclude the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam \r\nService Medal, TET Counteroffensive, Vietnam Counteroffensive \r\nPh. IV, V, VI, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.\r\n\r\nPost service, a VA clinical summary report from November 2003 \r\nthrough January 2004 indicates that when seen in January \r\n2004, the veteran reported problems with depression for \r\napproximately 20 years, and complained of intrusive memories \r\nof Vietnam.  He reportedly drank heavily in service but \r\nstopped heavy drinking after service.  The veteran was \r\ndiagnosed with an anxiety disorder; chronic PTSD; bipolar \r\ndisorder; depression; personality disorders/traits; and, \r\navoidant, obsessive compulsive disorder.\r\n\r\nIn a February 2004 VA progress note, the veteran complained \r\nof nightmares and intrusive memories of dead children.  He \r\nreported a stressor noting that while in Vietnam he was on \r\nthe way to get a water sample for mosquito larvae with \r\nanother preventive medicine specialist when they realized \r\nthey were in a minefield.  The other soldier began crying and \r\nthe veteran was extremely frightened\r\n\r\nA VA clinical summary report from April 2004 through \r\nSeptember 2004 reflects that the veteran's primary diagnosis \r\nwas PTSD, while a VA clinical summary report from February \r\nthrough May 2005 indicates he was diagnosed with chronic \r\ncombat PTSD.  \r\n\r\nSeveral other stressor incidents were noted in a September \r\n2004 VA progress note.  These include the veteran reporting \r\nthat his \"first kill\" was a young girl and that bothered \r\nhim; although he noted that, \"I don't really remember how it \r\nhappened.\"  He said that his unit was always being attacked \r\nat night and, on one occasion, the unit went out to collect \r\nenemy bodies the next day and he found the barber who shaved \r\nhim during the day among the dead.  He traveled around \r\nVietnam a lot due to his job and often came across burning \r\nmilitary vehicles with bodies in them.  He said that he \r\n\"watched a lot of guys die\".  Once he saw a soldier trapped \r\nin a burning vehicle; he did not know if he should shoot him \r\nor let him burn to death.  He reported that as a preventive \r\nmedicine specialist he would have to go with the choppers \r\nthat sprayed Agent Orange and other chemicals.  He noted \r\nthat, \"we sprayed all kinds of chemicals.\"  Two days after \r\nleaving Vietnam, his unit was overrun by the enemy.  He \r\nstated that, \"I know all the people died.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 2004, the RO received the veteran's Information \r\nin Support of Claim for Service Connection for Post-Traumatic \r\nStress Disorder (PTSD) Form and a lengthy written statement.  \r\nThe stressors listed by the veteran were that numerous (3-5) \r\npeople were killed or wounded in action while he was in the \r\n20th Preventive Medicine Unit, 172nd Battalion; and that \r\nnumerous (3-5) people were killed or wounded in action while \r\nhe was in the 926th Medical Detachment.  No other specific \r\ninformation was included in the report.\r\n\r\nWritten statements submitted by the veteran's spouse and son \r\nin November 2004, indicate that the appellant's character \r\nchanged after his separation from the military and he was \r\nangry, violent, and depressed.  A written statement from a \r\nservice buddy of the veteran's, D.T., reiterated primarily \r\nhis own experiences but included vague and unverifiable \r\nreports of stressors that included the veteran.\r\n\r\nDuring his May 2005 Board hearing, the veteran and D.T., his \r\nservice comrade, offered testimony.  The veteran testified \r\nthat his military training was to try and prevent disease.  \r\nHe said he arrived in Vietnam during the 1968 TET offensive \r\nand was at Bin Hoa.  While in Vietnam, he said he collected \r\nwater samples, and performed tests on mosquitoes for malaria.  \r\nOnce he was out misting for mosquitoes and, while spraying in \r\nan area, the unit at that location came under attack.  He had \r\nto remain overnight and fight.  He reported that he believed \r\nhe killed a young woman in the ensuing firefight.  He could \r\nnot remember the date or location but believed it occurred in \r\nApril, May, or June 1968.  Neither the veteran nor his \r\nservice comrade could offer any confirming dates or time \r\nperiods for that or several other incidents attested to.\r\n\r\nB. Analysis\r\n\r\nA review of the veteran's claims file shows the veteran \r\ncertainly has a current diagnosis of PTSD.  This is shown in \r\nthe VA medical records.  The issue before the Board, then, is \r\nwhether there is credible evidence of the veteran's claimed \r\nstressors, and whether there is a causal link between these \r\nstressors and the veteran's PTSD diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has described his alleged stressful events \r\nincluding unexpectedly finding himself in a minefield, \r\nkilling a young girl in a firefight, and watching other \r\nsoldiers die.\r\n\r\nThere has been a medical diagnosis of PTSD, attributed to the \r\nalleged stressor incidents, made VA physicians (in 2004).  \r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that there is some evidence of a \r\nstressor incident or incidents in service, evidence of a \r\ncurrent disability, and also seemingly competent evidence \r\nthat the current disability is a \"residual\" of the stressor \r\nexperienced in service.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, the Board must review the claim on its \r\nmerits, account for the evidence that it finds to be \r\npersuasive and unpersuasive, and provide reasoned analysis \r\nfor rejecting evidence submitted by or on behalf of the \r\nclaimant.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 \r\n(1990).  For a claim to be denied on its merits, the evidence \r\nmust preponderate against the claim.  The United States Court \r\nof Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has stated, \"It is \r\nclear that to deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must \r\npreponderate against the claim.\"  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. \r\nApp. 518, 519 (1996), citing Gilbert.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Board is not directly questioning the \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD in this claim.  However, by law, the \r\nevidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a \r\nrecognizable stressor during service to support a diagnosis \r\nof PTSD will vary depending upon whether the veteran engaged \r\nin \"combat with the enemy.\"  See Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. \r\n353 (1998) (Board must make a specific finding as to whether \r\nthe veteran engaged in combat).  If the claimed stressor is \r\nnot combat related, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, \r\nis not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged \r\nstressor.  Instead, the record must contain credible \r\nsupporting evidence from any source that corroborates the \r\nveteran's testimony or statements.  See e.g. Cohen, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 128, 147 (1997).\r\n\r\nHere, there is no supporting evidence from any source, \r\ndespite the RO's efforts to obtain such verification, to \r\ncorroborate the veteran's assertion of exposure to rocket and \r\nmortar fire in 1968.  As set forth below, he has not provided \r\nthe specifics, e.g., the who, what, where, and when of his \r\nalleged stressful events, such that VA can attempt to verify \r\nthem.  Nor do the veteran's service medical records support \r\nhis assertion of such exposure to rocket and mortar fire in \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Board concludes that the objective evidence of record \r\nfails to support a finding that the veteran engaged in combat \r\nwith the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for any determination with regard to PTSD \r\nis whether there is a \"stressor.\"  Under all versions of the \r\ncontrolling regulation, there must be credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor(s) actually \r\noccurred.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f).  The question of whether the \r\nveteran was exposed to a stressor in service is a factual \r\ndetermination, and VA adjudicators are not bound to accept \r\nsuch statements simply because treating medical providers \r\nhave done so.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 \r\n(1991); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614 (1992).  The \r\nexistence of an event alleged as a stressor that results in \r\nPTSD (though not the adequacy of the alleged event to cause \r\nPTSD) is an adjudicative, not a medical determination.  See \r\nZarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. at 91.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the service records do not show the veteran \r\nengaged in combat.  Thus, his bare assertions of service \r\nstressors are not sufficient to establish that they occurred; \r\nrather, his stressors must be established by official service \r\nrecords or other credible supporting evidence.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.304(f); Fossie v. West, 12 Vet. App. 1 (1998); Cohen v. \r\nBrown, supra; Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283 (1994).  See \r\nalso 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Court has held repeatedly that, where there is a current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, it must be presumed that the physician(s) \r\nmaking the diagnosis accepted the sufficiency of the in-\r\nservice stressor(s).  Nevertheless, since the diagnostician \r\ndoes not generally have firsthand knowledge of whether a \r\nstressor actually occurred, credible evidence is required to \r\nverify that element.  Pentecost v. Principe, 16 Vet. App.124 \r\n(2002).\r\n\r\nTo warrant service connection for PTSD, 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) \r\nprovides that the diagnosis must conform to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n4.125(a), and meet the criteria of the Fourth Edition of the \r\nAmerican Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical \r\nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).  Moreover, the diagnosis \r\nof PTSD must be based either on a claim of account of events \r\nduring demonstrated combat status or on verified stressors.  \r\nThe Board is not bound to accept any diagnosis not conforming \r\nto the DSM-IV criteria.  No probative weight may be assigned \r\nto a diagnosis of PTSD based on the veteran's unverified \r\nstressors.\r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran has identified his alleged stressors, \r\nnoted above, he has not described the events therein in \r\nsufficient detail such that a verification search by the \r\nUnited States Army and Joint Services Records Research Center \r\n(JSRRC) could \r\nbe conducted.  The veteran submitted the Information in \r\nSupport of Claim for Service Connection for Post-Traumatic \r\nStress Disorder (PTSD) Form with generalized vague claims of \r\nnumerous (3-5) people killed or wounded in action while he \r\nwas in the 20th Preventive Medicine Unit, 172nd Bn; and the \r\n926th Medical Detachment.  No other identifying information \r\nwas submitted nor was a specific time frame provided.  While \r\nthe VA is obligated to assist a claimant in the development \r\nof a claim, there is no duty on the VA to prove the claim.  \r\nSee Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  The \r\nCourt has held that the factual data required by VA to \r\nprovide a successful search, such as the names, dates, and \r\nplaces of the stressors, \"are straightforward facts and do \r\nnot place an impossible or onerous task on the appellant.  \r\nThe duty to assist is not always a one-way street.  If a \r\nveteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those \r\ncircumstances where he may or should have information that is \r\nessential in obtaining the putative evidence.\"  Id.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran has alleged in his VA claim that he \r\nengaged in combat (and he has told VA physicians that he \r\nengaged in combat) he has not provided the specifics of that \r\ncombat to verify his alleged stressors and, thus, his \r\nassertions, standing alone, cannot, as a matter of law, \r\nprovide evidence to establish that an in-service event \r\nclaimed as a stressor occurred.  See Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 \r\nVet. App. 163 (1996); West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 \r\n(1994).  Furthermore, service department records must \r\nsupport, and not contradict, the claimant's testimony \r\nregarding non-combat stressors.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. \r\nat 283.  This does not mean that he cannot establish that the \r\nalleged in-service events occurred; it only means that other \r\n\"credible supporting evidence from any source\" is necessary.  \r\nSee Cohen.  Since there is a diagnosis of PTSD here, it must \r\nbe determined whether there is credible supporting evidence \r\nof the veteran's alleged stressor, i.e., whether service \r\nrecords or other independent credible evidence do, in fact, \r\ncorroborate the alleged stressor.  See Dizolgio, supra.\r\n\r\nThe Court has held repeatedly that, where there is a current \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, it must be presumed that the physician(s) \r\nmaking the diagnosis accepted the sufficiency of the in- \r\nservice stressor(s).  Nevertheless, since the diagnostician \r\ndoes not generally have firsthand knowledge of whether a \r\nstressor actually occurred, credible evidence is required to \r\nverify that element.  See e.g., Pentecost v. Principi, 16 \r\nVet. App. 124 (2002).\r\n\r\nBased upon a review of the entire record in this case, and in \r\nview of the factors discussed above, the Board finds that the \r\nevidence of record has not corroborated the veteran's \r\nallegation of exposure to rocket and mortar fire in 1968 \r\nwhile in Vietnam.  Nor do the veteran's service documents \r\nsupport his participation in combat while he was in service.\r\n\r\nLikewise, medical statements which attempt to accept a \r\nclaimant's reports as credible and then relate a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD to events experienced in service do not constitute the \r\nrequisite credible evidence of a stressor.  Moreau v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. at 389.  As noted above, several VA treatment \r\nreports reflect that the examiners have indicated that the \r\nveteran's current diagnosed psychiatric disorders, \r\nparticularly PTSD, were due to combat, and to his description \r\nof witnessing incidents of exposure to mortar and rocket fire \r\nin Vietnam.  Clearly, those treating psychiatric physicians \r\ndid not undertake review of the veteran's service records, \r\nbut based their premises of his combat-related stressful \r\nevents in Vietnam solely upon the veteran's statements to \r\nthem.  The filtering of the veteran's account of his military \r\nservice through his physician does not transform the \r\nveteran's account into competent medical evidence, or an \r\naccurate account of those experiences, merely because the \r\ntranscriber happens to be a medical professional.  See \r\nLeShore v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 409 (1995).\r\n\r\nMoreover, with regard to the medical evidence, a diagnosis or \r\nopinion by a health care professional is not conclusive and \r\nis not entitled to absolute deference.  Indeed, the Court has \r\nprovided guidance for weighing medical evidence.  The Court \r\nhas held, for example, that a post-service reference to \r\ninjuries sustained in service, without a review of service \r\nmedical records, is not competent medical evidence. Grover v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 109, 112 (1999).  A medical opinion based \r\nupon speculation, without supporting clinical data or other \r\nrationale, does not provide the required degree of medical \r\ncertainty.  Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999). \r\nOther factors for assessing the probative value of a medical \r\nopinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the \r\nclaimant's history, and the thoroughness and detail of the \r\nopinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 \r\n(2000). Further, a medical opinion is inadequate when it is \r\nunsupported by clinical evidence.  Black v. Brown, 5 Vet. \r\nApp. 177, 180 (1995).  A medical opinion based on an \r\ninaccurate factual premise is not probative.  Reonal v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).  A bare conclusion, even \r\none reached by a health care professional, is not probative \r\nwithout a factual predicate in the record.  Miller v. West, \r\n11 Vet. App. 345, 348 (1998); LeShore v. Brown, supra.\r\n\r\nAs a layperson, the veteran is not competent to render a \r\nmedical opinion in this regard.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 \r\nVet. App. 492, 495 (1992).  See also Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. \r\nApp. 183, 186 (1997) (\"a layperson is generally not capable \r\nof opining on matters requiring medical knowledge\"), aff'd \r\nsub nom. Routen v. West, 142 F.3d 1434 (Fed. Cir. 1998), \r\ncert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 404 (1998).  Accordingly, a veteran \r\nis not entitled to service connection for PTSD under a theory \r\nthat the disorder resulted from unverified, inconsistently \r\nreported stressors during service.\r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the record \r\ndoes not support the veteran's assertion that he was exposed \r\nto rocket and mortar fire in 1968 in Vietnam.  Thus, although \r\nthe foundation for the diagnosis of PTSD in this case was the \r\nveteran's account of his combat service in Vietnam and \r\nexposure to rocket and mortar fire in Vietnam in 1968, we \r\nmust conclude that the claimed stressors have not been \r\nsatisfactorily established as having occurred. The veteran \r\nmay very well consider events that occurred in conjunction \r\nwith his alleged witnessing of the 1968 events in service to \r\nbe stressful, but he has failed to provide even one factual \r\ndetail of the alleged events on which to base his claim, \r\nother than repeated but vague and unfounded descriptions of \r\nexposure to rocket and mortar attacks during combat service \r\nin Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThus, while the veteran does have a diagnosis of PTSD based \r\nupon his purported in-service stressors, these stressors are \r\nnot shown by satisfactory evidence to have occurred.  With \r\nall due respect to the veteran, we find that his, and his \r\nfamily and friends' oral and written statements in support of \r\nhis claim are, thus, unsubstantiated and are of little \r\nevidentiary weight.  Having so concluded, the Board finds \r\nthat the preponderance of the credible evidence is against \r\nthe claim, and that neither a VA psychiatric examination nor \r\nfurther interpretation by a clinician of the in-service \r\nsymptoms/behavior is necessary.  Since the preponderance of \r\nthe evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt \r\ndoctrine is not for application.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); \r\nGilbert v.

J. N.

The veteran then appealed the Board's \r\ndecision to the United States Court of Veterans Appeals \r\n(Court).  In July 2004, based on a Joint Motion For Remand \r\n(joint motion), the Court vacated the Board's August 2002 \r\ndecision and remanded the claim to the Board for \r\nreadjudication consistent with the joint motion.  In December \r\n2004, the Board, in turn, remanded the claim to the RO via \r\nthe Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.

Adenocarcinoma of the left kidney is not related to the \r\nveteran's active service and did not manifest to a \r\ncompensable degree within a year of the veteran's discharge \r\nfrom service.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAdenocarcinoma of the left kidney was not incurred in or \r\naggravated by service and may not be presumed to have been so \r\nincurred.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5102, 5103, 5103A (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2006).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  VA's Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2000, the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \r\n2000 (VCAA), codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002), became law.  Regulations \r\nimplementing the VCAA were then published at \r\n66 Fed. Reg. 45,620, 45,630-32 (August 29, 2001) and codified \r\nat 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326 (2006).  The \r\nVCAA and its implementing regulations are applicable to this \r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThe VCAA and its implementing regulations provide, in part, \r\nthat VA will notify the claimant and the claimant's \r\nrepresentative, if any, of the information and medical or lay \r\nevidence not previously provided to the Secretary that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, \r\nVA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's \r\nrepresentative, if any, of which portion of the evidence the \r\nclaimant is to provide and which portion of the evidence VA \r\nwill attempt to obtain on the claimant's behalf.  They also \r\nrequire VA to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate a claim, but such assistance is not \r\nrequired if there is no reasonable possibility that such \r\nassistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) has mandated that VA ensure strict compliance with \r\nthe provisions of the VCAA.  See Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 \r\nVet. App. 183 (2002).  In this case, VA provided the veteran \r\nadequate notice and assistance with regard to his claim such \r\nthat the Board's decision to proceed in adjudicating this \r\nclaim does not prejudice the veteran in the disposition \r\nthereof.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 392-94 (1993). \r\n\r\nA.  Duty to Notify\r\n\r\nThe Court has indicated that notice under the VCAA must be \r\ngiven prior to an initial unfavorable decision by the agency \r\nof original jurisdiction.  In Pelegrini v. Principi \r\n(Pelegrini II), 18 Vet. App. 112, 119-20 (2004), the Court \r\nalso indicated that the VCAA requires VA to provide notice, \r\nconsistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(A), 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b), and Quartuccio, that informs the claimant \r\nof any information and evidence not of record (1) that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim, (2) that VA will seek to \r\nprovide, and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  \r\nIn what can be considered a fourth element of the requisite \r\nnotice, the Court further held that, under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(b), VA must request the claimant to provide any \r\nevidence in his possession that pertains to the claim.  Id. \r\nat 120-21.\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 2006, the Court held that the aforementioned \r\nnotice requirements apply to all five elements of a service \r\nconnection claim, including: (1) veteran status; (2) \r\nexistence of disability; (3) a connection between service and \r\ndisability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date \r\nof disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473, 484 (2006).  The Court further held that notice under \r\nthe VCAA must inform the claimant that, if the RO grants his \r\nservice connection claim, it will then assign such an award a \r\ndisability rating and an effective date.  Id. at 486.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the RO provided the veteran VCAA notice on the \r\nclaim at issue by letter dated January 2005, after initially \r\ndeciding that claim in a rating decision dated September \r\n1999.  Such notice was not mandated at the time of the RO's \r\nrating decision; therefore, the RO did not err by providing \r\nthe veteran remedial notice.  Rather, the timing of such \r\nnotice reflects compliance with the requirements of the law \r\nas found by the Court in Pelegrini II.  \r\n\r\nThe content of the such notice also reflects compliance with \r\nthe requirements of the law as found by the Court in \r\nPelegrini II.  In the January 2005 VCAA notice letter, the RO \r\nacknowledged the veteran's claim for service connection, \r\nnotified him of the evidence needed to substantiate that \r\nclaim, identified the type of evidence that would best do so, \r\ninformed him of VA's duty to assist and indicated that it was \r\ndeveloping his claim pursuant to that duty.  As well, the RO \r\nidentified the evidence it had received in support of the \r\nveteran's claim and the evidence it was responsible for \r\nsecuring.  The RO noted that it would make reasonable efforts \r\nto assist the veteran in obtaining all outstanding evidence \r\nprovided he identified the source(s) thereof.  The RO also \r\nnoted that, ultimately, it was the veteran's responsibility \r\nto ensure VA's receipt of all pertinent evidence.  The RO \r\nadvised the veteran to sign the enclosed forms authorizing \r\nthe release of his treatment records if he wished VA to \r\nobtain such records on his behalf.  The RO also advised the \r\nveteran to identify or send directly to VA all requested \r\nevidence to support his claim.  \r\n\r\nThe content of this notice letter does not reflect compliance \r\nwith the requirements of the law as found by the Court in \r\nDingess/Hartman.  Therein, the RO did not provide the veteran \r\ninformation on disability ratings or effective dates.  \r\nHowever, the veteran has not been prejudiced as a result \r\nthereof.  Bernard, 4 Vet. App. at 394.  Rather, in a letter \r\ndated March 2006, the RO corrected this procedural deficiency \r\nby providing the veteran such information.  \r\n\r\nB.  Duty to Assist\r\n\r\nVA made reasonable efforts to identify and obtain relevant \r\nrecords in support of the veteran's service connection claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(a), (b), (c) (West 2002).  Specifically, \r\nthe RO secured and associated with the claims file all \r\nevidence the veteran identified as being pertinent to his \r\nclaims, including service medical records and post-service VA \r\nand private treatment records.  Since then, the veteran has \r\nnot asserted that there is any other pertinent evidence to \r\nadd to the claims file.  \r\n\r\nThe RO also conducted medical inquiry in an effort to \r\nsubstantiate the veteran's claim by affording the veteran a \r\nVA examination, during which an examiner addressed the \r\netiology of the disorder at issue in this appeal, and by \r\nobtaining a medical opinion regarding the etiology of that \r\ndisorder.  Since the last opinion was associated with the \r\nclaims file, the veteran has not asserted that the medical \r\nevidence of record is inadequate.  \r\n\r\nUnder the facts of this case, \"the record has been fully \r\ndeveloped,\" and \"it is difficult to discern what additional \r\nguidance VA could have provided to the veteran regarding what \r\nadditional evidence he should submit to substantiate his \r\nclaim.\"  Conway v. Principi, 353 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004); \r\nsee also Livesay v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 165, 178 (2001) \r\n(en banc) (observing that the VCAA is a reason to remand \r\nmany, many claims, but it is not an excuse to remand all \r\nclaims); Reyes v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 113, 116 (1994); Soyini \r\nv. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (both observing \r\ncircumstances as to when a remand would not result in any \r\nsignificant benefit to the claimant); Mayfield v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 103, 115 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, 444 \r\nF.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 5, 2006) (holding that an error, \r\nwhether procedural or substantive, is prejudicial when the \r\nerror affects a substantial right so as to injure an interest \r\nthat the statutory or regulatory provision involved was \r\ndesigned to protect to the extent that it affects the \r\nessential fairness of the adjudication).  \r\n\r\nII.  Analysis of Claim\r\n\r\nThe veteran seeks service connection for adenocarcinoma of \r\nthe left kidney.  He asserts that he developed this disease \r\nin service secondary to an unsterile catheterization \r\nconducted prior to an operation.  Allegedly, after the \r\noperation, he began experiencing recurrent urinary tract \r\ninfections and was then misdiagnosed with prostatitis.  He \r\nasserts that this misdiagnosed medical condition actually \r\nrepresented the initial manifestation of his left kidney \r\ncancer.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2006).  \r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease \r\ndiagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including \r\nthat pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nSubsequent manifestations of a chronic disease in service, \r\nhowever remote, are to be service connected, unless clearly \r\nattributable to intercurrent causes.  For the showing of \r\nchronic disease in service there is required a combination of \r\nmanifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and \r\nsufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, \r\nas distinguished from merely isolated findings or diagnosis \r\nincluding the word \"chronic.\"  Continuity of symptomatology \r\nis required only where the condition noted during service is \r\nnot, in fact, shown to be chronic or when the diagnosis of \r\nchronicity may be legitimately questioned.  When the fact of \r\nchronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a \r\nshowing of continuity after discharge is required to support \r\nthe claim.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nService connection may be presumed for malignant tumors it is \r\nshown that the veteran served continuously for 90 days or \r\nmore during a period of war or during peacetime after \r\nDecember 31, 1946, and manifested such condition to a degree \r\nof 10 percent within one year from the date of discharge and \r\nthere is no evidence of record establishing otherwise.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112(a), 1113 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n3.307, 3.309(a) (2006).  \r\n\r\nIn order to prevail with regard to the issue of service \r\nconnection on the merits, there must be medical evidence of a \r\ncurrent disability, see Rabideau v. Derwinski, \r\n2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992); medical or, in certain \r\ncircumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence of a \r\nnexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and \r\nthe present disease or injury.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  \r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the \r\nresponsibility to present and support a claim for benefits \r\nunder laws administered by the Secretary.  The Secretary \r\nshall consider all information and lay and medical evidence \r\nof record in a case before the Secretary with respect to \r\nbenefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  When \r\nthere is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding any issue material to the determination of \r\na matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt \r\nto the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107 (West 2002); see also \r\nGilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, post-service VA and private treatment records \r\nconfirm that the veteran has received treatment, including a \r\nnephrectomy, for adenocarcinoma of the left kidney.  The \r\nquestion thus becomes whether this disease is related to the \r\nveteran's active service, including the alleged unsterile \r\ncatheterization, recurrent urinary tract infections, or \r\nkidney disorder misdiagnosed as prostatitis.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records reflect that, during \r\nactive service, no medical professional diagnosed the veteran \r\nwith a kidney disorder, including adenocarcinoma of the left \r\nkidney.  Medical professionals did, however, treat the \r\nveteran for recurrent urinary tract infections and \r\nprostatitis.  \r\n\r\nA VA physician first noted a mass in the veteran's left \r\nkidney in 1996, over forty years after the veteran's \r\ndischarge from service.  VA and private physicians later \r\ndiagnosed such mass as renal cell carcinoma and then \r\nadenocarcinoma of the left kidney.  In 1997, this disease \r\nnecessitated removal of the veteran's left kidney.  Since \r\nthen, the veteran has undergone follow-up renal evaluations \r\nand VA examinations, during which no medical professional \r\nlinked the veteran's left kidney cancer to his period of \r\nactive service, including the alleged unsterile \r\ncatheterization, recurrent urinary tract infections, or \r\nkidney disorder misdiagnosed as prostatitis.  \r\n  \r\nIn a letter dated March 1999, Paul B. Handel, M.D., noted \r\nthat the veteran had not been treated for any symptoms of \r\nprostatitis since February 1997, when the veteran first \r\nsought his care.  He did not address the veteran's contention \r\nthat he was misdiagnosed with prostatitis in service and that \r\nthe symptoms attributable to such diagnosis were actually the \r\ninitial manifestations of the adenocarcinoma of his left \r\nkidney.   \r\n\r\nIn an undated note received in March 2000, A. Knowlton, M.D., \r\nindicated that the veteran did not have a prostate problem, \r\nbut recurrent urinary tract infections that started in \r\nservice.  Dr. Knowlton further indicated that the veteran \r\nwent on to develop renal cancer, had his kidney removed in \r\n1997 and, thereafter, experienced resolution of all of his \r\nurinary symptoms.  Although in so stating, Dr. Knowlton \r\nintimated that a certain relationship existed between the \r\nveteran's renal cancer and his in-service urinary tract \r\ninfections, he did not specifically offer such an opinion.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, VA sought medical opinions regarding this \r\nmatter.  In April 2001, one VA examiner/physician examined \r\nthe veteran, acknowledged his history of in-service \r\nnonsterile instrumentation, urinary tract infections and \r\nprostatitis and, based on urological literature, ruled out a \r\nrelationship between his renal cell carcinoma and his upper \r\nand lower urinary tract infections.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2005, another VA examiner/physician reviewed the \r\nmedical record, acknowledged the same previously noted in-\r\nservice medical history, and opined that there is no evidence \r\nof record that the veteran's military service contributed in \r\nany way to his development of adenocarcinoma of the kidney.  \r\nThe VA examiner/physician explained that renal cell carcinoma \r\nis of undetermined origin and has no documented relationship \r\nto chronic urinary tract infections or any known carcinogen.  \r\nHe concluded that it is more likely than not that the \r\nveteran's renal cell cancer evolved as a consequence of \r\nroutine pathological processes unrelated to the veteran's \r\nmilitary service.    \r\n\r\nAs noted above, to prevail in a claim for service connection, \r\nthe veteran must submit competent evidence establishing that \r\nhe has a current disability resulting from service.  In this \r\ncase, the veteran's assertions represent the only evidence of \r\nrecord establishing that adenocarcinoma of his left kidney is \r\nat least as likely as not related to his active service.  \r\nSuch assertions are insufficient to establish the necessary \r\nnexus in this case as the record does not reflect that the \r\nveteran possesses a recognized degree of medical knowledge to \r\nrender a competent opinion on causation.  Espiritu v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494-95 (1992) (holding that \r\nlaypersons are not competent to offer medical opinions). \r\n\r\nInasmuch as there is no competent medical evidence of record \r\nrelating adenocarcinoma of the left kidney to the veteran's \r\nactive service or establishing that that disease manifested \r\nto a compensable degree within a year of his discharge from \r\nactive service, the Board concludes that such disease was not \r\nincurred in or aggravated by service and may not be presumed \r\nto have been so incurred.  The evidence is not in relative \r\nequipoise; therefore, the veteran may not be afforded the \r\nbenefit of the doubt in the resolution of this claim.  \r\nRather, as a preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nclaim, such claim must be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for adenocarcinoma, left kidney, is \r\ndenied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nV.

D. Watson, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from May 1944 to March \r\n1946.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a September 2004 RO decision which \r\ndenied service connection for prostate cancer, to include as \r\nthe result of ionizing radiation exposure.\r\n\r\nThe veteran testified before the undersigned at a September \r\n2007 videoconference hearing.  A transcript has been \r\nassociated with the file.\r\n\r\nIn September 2007, the Board granted a motion to advance the \r\ncase on the docket due to the veteran's advanced age.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2007).\r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that the veteran submitted evidence \r\nin November 2006, consisting of an online encyclopedia \r\narticle providing information about the U.S.S. Logan.  The \r\nevidence does not appear to have been considered by the \r\nAgency of Original Jurisdiction prior to recertification of \r\nthe appeal to the Board.  To the extent to which this \r\nevidence discusses where the veteran was stationed, it is \r\nessentially duplicative of evidence previously considered.  \r\nThe Board will proceed.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1304.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The veteran was not exposed to ionizing radiation during \r\nservice as verified by a dose estimate which yielded negative \r\nresults; and there is no competent evidence establishing a \r\nnexus between the veteran's prostate cancer and alleged \r\nradiation exposure during service.\r\n\r\n2.  Prostate problems were not manifest during active \r\nservice; a malignant tumor of the prostate was not noted \r\nwithin one year of service separation; prostate cancer is not \r\netiologically related to service, to include the claimed in-\r\nservice radiation exposure.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nProstate cancer was not incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nservice on either a direct basis or as due to exposure to \r\nionizing radiation, nor may the veteran's prostate cancer be \r\npresumed to have been incurred therein.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 101, \r\n106, 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.311 (2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the \r\nveteran's claims folder.  Although the Board has an \r\nobligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this \r\ndecision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the \r\nevidence submitted by the veteran or on his behalf.  See \r\nGonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) \r\n(the Board must review the entire record, but does not have \r\nto discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below \r\nfocuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what \r\nthis evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim.  The \r\nveteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces \r\nof evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.  See \r\nTimberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law \r\nrequires only that the Board address its reasons for \r\nrejecting evidence favorable to the veteran).  \r\n\r\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of all \r\nevidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its \r\nprobative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be \r\npersuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for \r\nrejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  Equal \r\nweight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in \r\nthe record; every item of evidence does not have the same \r\nprobative value.  When all the evidence is assembled, VA is \r\nresponsible for determining whether the evidence supports the \r\nclaim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant \r\nprevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is \r\ndenied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nI.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the veteran's claim, VA has met all statutory \r\nand regulatory notice and duty to assist provisions.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326.\r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, when VA receives a complete or substantially \r\ncomplete application for benefits, it is required to notify \r\nthe claimant and his representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) (2007); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. \r\nApp. 183 (2002).  In Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, \r\n120-21 (2004) (Pelegrini II), the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA must inform \r\nthe claimant of any information and evidence not of record \r\n(1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA \r\nwill seek to provide; (3) that the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide; and (4) request that the claimant provide any \r\nevidence in his possession that pertains to the claim.  \r\n\r\nPrior to initial adjudication of the veteran's claim, a \r\nletter dated in July 2003 fully satisfied the duty to notify \r\nprovisions.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1); \r\nQuartuccio, at 187.  The veteran was aware that it was \r\nultimately his responsibility to give VA any evidence \r\npertaining to the claim.  The July 2003 letter told him to \r\nprovide any relevant evidence in his possession.  See \r\nPelegrini II, at 120-121.\r\n\r\nSince the Board has concluded that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claim for service connection, any \r\nquestions as to the appropriate disability rating or \r\neffective date to be assigned are rendered moot, and no \r\nfurther notice is needed.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \r\nApp. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Board also concludes VA's duty to assist has been \r\nsatisfied.  The veteran's service medical records and VA \r\nmedical records are in the file.  Private medical records \r\nidentified by the veteran have been obtained, to the extent \r\npossible.  The veteran has at no time referenced outstanding \r\nrecords that he wanted VA to obtain or that he felt were \r\nrelevant to the claim.\r\n\r\nThe duty to assist also includes providing a medical \r\nexamination or obtaining a medical opinion when such is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim, as defined by law.\r\n\r\nAlthough the veteran was not afforded a medical examination \r\nto obtain an opinion as to whether his prostate cancer can be \r\ndirectly attributed to service, an examination or opinion is \r\nnot needed on the claim because, at a minimum, there is no \r\npersuasive and competent evidence that the claimed condition \r\nmay be associated with the veteran's military service.  This \r\nis discussed in more detail below.\r\n\r\nAs there is no indication that any failure on the part of VA \r\nto provide additional notice or assistance reasonably affects \r\nthe outcome of this case, the Board finds that any such \r\nfailure is harmless.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n103 (2005), rev'd on other grounds, Mayfield v. Nicholson, \r\n444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he developed prostate cancer as a \r\nresult of ionizing radiation exposure from an active duty \r\nassignment that sent him to Hiroshima, Japan in early 1946.  \r\nFor the reasons that follow, the Board concludes that service \r\nconnection is not warranted.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110.  Service connection may \r\nalso be granted for certain specified chronic diseases, \r\nincluding malignant tumors, shown to be manifested to a \r\ncompensable degree within one year from the date of service \r\nseparation.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309. \r\n\r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service there is \r\nrequired a combination of manifestations sufficient to \r\nidentify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to \r\nestablish chronicity at the time.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  If \r\nchronicity in service is not established, a showing of \r\ncontinuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support \r\nthe claim.  Id.  Service connection may be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence \r\nestablishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for the claimed \r\ndisorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \r\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 \r\n(1999).\r\n\r\nService connection for conditions claimed to be due to \r\nexposure to ionizing radiation in service can be established \r\nin any of three different ways, which have been outlined by \r\nthe Court.  See Davis v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 209, 211 (1997); \r\nRucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 71 (1997); see also Ramey \r\nv. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1996), aff'd, 120 F.3d. 1239 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 1997).  The Board will address each of these three \r\nmethods in the adjudication that follows.\r\n\r\nFirst, the VA has identified certain diseases which are \r\npresumed to be the result of radiation exposure.  Such a \r\npresumption, of course, must be based upon a finding that the \r\nveteran was, in fact, \"a radiation-exposed veteran.\" 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1112(c); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(d).  In applying this \r\nstatutory presumption, there is no requirement for \r\ndocumenting the level of radiation exposure.  However, \r\nprostate cancer is not listed under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(d)(3).  \r\nTherefore, these presumptive provisions are not applicable in \r\nthe instant case.\r\n\r\nSecond, there are other radiogenic diseases, to include \r\nprostate cancer, which may be service connected directly \r\nunder the special framework set forth in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311.  \r\nOther \"radiogenic\" diseases, such as any form of cancer, \r\nlisted under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(b)(2), found 5 years or more \r\nafter service (for most of the listed diseases) in an \r\nionizing radiation exposed veteran may also be service-\r\nconnected if the VA Under Secretary for Benefits determines \r\nthat they are related to ionizing radiation exposure while in \r\nservice or if they are otherwise linked medically to ionizing \r\nradiation exposure while in service.  The veteran may provide \r\ncompetent scientific or medical evidence that the disease \r\nclaimed to be the result of radiation exposure is, in fact, a \r\nradiogenic disease.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(b)(4).\r\n\r\nSection 3.311(a) calls for the development of a radiation \r\ndose assessment where it is established that a radiogenic \r\ndisease first became manifest after service, where it was not \r\nmanifest to a compensable degree within any applicable \r\npresumptive period specified in either 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307 or \ufffd \r\n3.309, and where it is contended that the disease is a result \r\nof ionizing radiation in service.  This includes the request \r\nof dose data from the Department of Defense.  See 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.311(a)(2)(ii).  The dose data is then forwarded to the \r\nUnder Secretary for Benefits for consideration.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(c)(1).\r\n\r\nAs prostate cancer is listed as a radiogenic disease, the \r\nveteran's claim was forwarded to the Defense Threat Reduction \r\nAgency for a radiation dose estimate based on the veteran's \r\nclaim that he had traveled to Hiroshima in early 1946.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(a)(2)(ii).  In August 2004, the Defense \r\nThreat Reduction Agency responded that, during the veteran's \r\nservice aboard the U.S.S. Logan, he was at least \r\napproximately 175 miles from Hiroshima and 325 miles from \r\nNagasaki.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency concluded that \r\nit could not confirm the veteran's presence in Hiroshima or \r\nNagasaki and declined to offer a dose estimate.  As the \r\nevidence does not show that the veteran had radiation \r\nactivity, the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(b)(1) are not \r\nmet and forwarding the file to the Under Secretary for \r\nBenefits would be futile.  In light of the foregoing, the \r\nBoard finds that the veteran had no exposure to ionizing \r\nradiation in service.  Although the Board notes the veteran's \r\nclaims that he traveled by small landing craft to visit the \r\nnuclear aftermath of Hiroshima, these claims have not been \r\nsubstantiated and contradict the evidence of record that \r\nshows that the veteran was approximately 175 miles from \r\nHiroshima.  The Board thus concludes that the presumptive \r\nservice connection provisions for ionizing radiation are not \r\napplicable in this case.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311.\r\n\r\nEven if the disease in question is not listed in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.309 and is not a radiogenic disease under \ufffd 3.311, the \r\nveteran is not foreclosed from proving direct service \r\nconnection by establishing direct actual causation under 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  See Combee v. Brown, \r\n34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  Under Combee, VA \r\nmust not only determine whether a veteran had a disability \r\nrecognized by VA as being etiologically related to exposure \r\nto ionizing radiation, but must also determine whether the \r\ndisability was otherwise the result of active service.  In \r\nother words, the fact that the requirements of a presumptive \r\nregulation are not met does not in and of itself preclude a \r\nclaimant from establishing service connection by way of proof \r\nof actual direct causation.\r\n\r\nThe veteran claims that his prostate cancer is the result of \r\nservice.  The veteran's service medical records are devoid of \r\nany complaint, finding, or treatment of prostate cancer or \r\nany other disorder of the genitourinary system.  There is no \r\nevidence of a malignant tumor of the prostate within 1 year \r\nof service separation.  Indeed, in his July 2003 claim, the \r\nveteran admits that he was not diagnosed with prostate cancer \r\nuntil around 1991, almost 45 years after service.\r\n\r\nPrivate medical records reflect that the veteran underwent a \r\nprostatectomy in February 1993 to remove prostatic carcinoma.  \r\nNone of the private treatment reports submitted by the \r\nveteran mentions his service, and they do not relate his \r\nprostate cancer to service or to any event therein.  There is \r\nno competent medical opinion of record that concludes the \r\nveteran's prostate cancer was the result of service.  \r\nAlthough the veteran contends otherwise, he is not competent \r\nto render an opinion as to the cause or etiology of his \r\nprostate cancer.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 \r\n(1992) (holding that, where a veteran lacked the requisite \r\nmedical knowledge and medical training, he was not competent \r\nto diagnose any medical disorder or render an opinion as to \r\nthe cause or etiology of any current disorder).  Thus, \r\nservice connection for prostate cancer is not warranted.  See \r\nHickman, supra.  \r\n\r\nAs such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the veteran's claim.  Consequently, the \r\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must \r\nbe denied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, to \r\ninclude on the basis of exposure to ionizing radiation, is \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK.

Ancheta-Mejica, \r\nAttorney\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nMichael T. Osborne, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had recognized guerilla service in the \r\nPhilippines from November 1942 to July 1945 and Philippine \r\nCommonwealth Army service from July 1945 to February 1946.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal of a May 2003 rating decision issued by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nManila, the Republic of the Philippines, which denied the \r\nveteran's claim for service connection for malaria, to \r\ninclude recurrent episodes or residuals of malaria.  In the \r\ncover letter to this rating decision, the RO also denied \r\nentitlement to non-service-connected disability pension \r\nbenefits.  The veteran disagreed with the denial of his claim \r\nfor service connection for malaria in January 2004 and \r\nperfected a timely appeal in September 2004.\r\n\r\nIn March 2006, the Board remanded the veteran's claim to the \r\nRO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, \r\nD.C., for additional development.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All evidence necessary to decide this claim has been \r\nobtained; the RO has notified the veteran of the evidence \r\nneeded to substantiate his claim and obtained all relevant \r\nevidence designated by the veteran.\r\n\r\n2.  There is no medical evidence of malaria until decades \r\npost-service; the preponderance of the competent evidence is \r\nagainst a nexus between post-service malaria and service; the \r\npreponderance of the medical evidence is against a current \r\ndiagnosis of malaria, to include recurrent episodes or \r\nresiduals of malaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for malaria, to include recurrent episodes \r\nor residuals of malaria, is not warranted. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n1110, 1112, 1113, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd  3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2000, the President signed into law the VCAA.  \r\nSee Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (2000), codified at \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002).  The VCAA \r\nprovides, among other things, for notice and assistance to VA \r\nclaimants under certain circumstances.  VA has issued final \r\nrules amending its adjudication regulations to implement the \r\nprovisions of the VCAA.  See generally 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, \r\n3.156(a), 3.159, and 3.326(a)) (2006).  The intended effect \r\nof these regulations is to establish clear guidelines \r\nconsistent with the intent of Congress regarding the timing \r\nand the scope of assistance VA will provide to a claimant who \r\nfiles a substantially complete application for VA benefits or \r\nwho attempts to reopen a previously denied claim.\r\n\r\nIn order to be consistent with 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b), VCAA notice must: (1) inform the claimant \r\nabout the information and evidence not of record that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim; (2) inform the claimant \r\nabout the information and evidence that VA will seek to \r\nprovide; (3) inform the claimant about the information and \r\nevidence the claimant is expected to provide; and (4) request \r\nor tell the claimant to provide any evidence in the \r\nclaimant's possession that pertains to the claim.  This \r\nfourth element of the notice requirement comes from the \r\nlanguage of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1).  In Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004) (Pelegrini II), the United \r\nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) \r\nheld, in part, that a VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before the initial \r\nunfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on \r\na claim for VA benefits.\r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, on March 3, 2006, the \r\nVeterans Court issued a decision in the consolidated appeal \r\nof Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), \r\nwhich held that the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements \r\nof a service connection claim.  Those five elements include: \r\n1) veteran status; 2) existence of a disability; (3) a \r\nconnection between the veteran's service and the disability; \r\n4) degree of disability; and 5) effective date of the \r\ndisability.  The Veterans Court held that, upon receipt of an \r\napplication for a service-connection claim, 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) require VA to review the \r\ninformation and the evidence presented with the claim and to \r\nprovide the claimant with notice of what information and \r\nevidence not previously provided, if any, will assist in \r\nsubstantiating or is necessary to substantiate the elements \r\nof the claim as reasonably contemplated by the application.  \r\nAdditionally, this notice must indicate that a disability \r\nrating and an effective date for the award of benefits will \r\nbe assigned if service connection is awarded.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that VA has met these duties with regard to \r\nthe claim adjudicated on the merits in this decision.  There \r\nis no issue as to providing an appropriate application form \r\nor completeness of the application.  Written notice provided \r\nin February 2003 and July 2006 fulfills the provisions of \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a).  That is, the veteran was effectively \r\ninformed to submit all relevant evidence in his possession \r\nand that he received notice of the evidence needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim; the avenues by which he might obtain \r\nsuch evidence, and the allocation of responsibilities between \r\nhimself and VA in obtaining such evidence.  See Beverly v. \r\nNicholson\ufffd19 Vet. App. 394, 403 (2005); see also Mayfield v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103, 109-12 (2005) (Mayfield I) rev'd \r\non other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the Dingess requirements, letters dated in \r\nJuly 2006 and February 2007 provided the veteran with notice \r\nof potential ratings and effective dates as outlined by the \r\nVeterans Court in Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 \r\n(2006).\r\n\r\nThe Board recognizes that, according to Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 119-20 (2004), proper VCAA notice \r\nmust \"precede an initial unfavorable [agency of original \r\njurisdiction (AOJ)] decision on a service-connection claim.\"  \r\nThe February 2003 VCAA notice was furnished to the veteran \r\nand his representative prior to the May 2003 RO decision that \r\nis the subject of this appeal.  To the extent that there was \r\nany timing deficiency with this notice or with the Dingess \r\nrequirements, as noted above, the Dingess requirements were \r\nmet by a letter sent to the veteran in July 2006, but the \r\nveteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for \r\nmalaria was readjudicated in a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase (SSOC) issued in November 2006.  The United States Court \r\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held \r\nthat timing-of-notice errors can be \"cured\" by notification \r\nfollowed by readjudication.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d \r\n1328, 133-34 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Mayfield II); see Prickett v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006) (\"The Federal \r\nCircuit specifically mentioned two remedial measures:  (1) \r\nThe issuance of a fully compliant [section 5103(a)] \r\nnotification, followed by (2) readjudication of the \r\nclaim.\"); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 122-24 \r\n(2004) (\"proper subsequent VA process\" can cure error in \r\ntiming of notice).\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Court has held recently that a SSOC that \r\ncomplies with applicable due process and notification \r\nrequirements constitutes a readjudication decision.  Mayfield \r\nv. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 537 (2006) (Mayfield III); see \r\nalso Prickett, supra (holding that a Statement of the Case \r\nthat complies with all applicable due process and \r\nnotification requirements constitutes a readjudication \r\ndecision).  As the November 2006 SSOC complied with the \r\napplicable due process and notification requirements for a \r\ndecision, it constitutes a readjudication decision.  \r\nAccordingly, the provision of adequate notice followed by a \r\nreadjudication \"cures\" any timing problem associated with \r\ninadequate notice or the lack of notice prior to an initial \r\nadjudication.  Mayfield III, 20 Vet. App. at 541-42, citing \r\nMayfield II, 444 F.3d at 1333-34.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, the evidence does not show, nor does the \r\nappellant contend, that any notification deficiencies, either \r\nwith respect to timing or content, have resulted in \r\nprejudice.  That is, there has been no plausible showing of \r\nhow the essential fairness of the adjudication was affected.  \r\nSee Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103, 128, 129 (2005), \r\nrev'd on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (due \r\nprocess concerns with respect to VCAA notice must be pled \r\nwith specificity).  See also Overton v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. \r\nApp. 427 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that all necessary assistance has been \r\nprovided to the appellant.  The evidence includes service \r\nmedical records, service personnel records, private treatment \r\nrecords, and VA medical records, including VA examination \r\nreports.  There is no indication of any additional relevant \r\nevidence that has not been obtained.  Pursuant to the Board's \r\nMarch 2006 remand, the veteran was provided with an August \r\n2006 VA examination, which was very thorough in nature and \r\nthat evaluation ruled out a current diagnosis of malaria, to \r\ninclude recurrent episodes or residuals of malaria.  The \r\nevidence is adequate to resolve this claim; there is no duty \r\nto provide another examination or a medical opinion.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4).\r\n \r\nIn view of the foregoing, the Board finds that VA has \r\nfulfilled its duty to notify and assist the appellant in the \r\nclaim under consideration.  Adjudication of the claim at this \r\njuncture, without directing or accomplishing any additional \r\nnotification and/or development action, poses no risk of \r\nprejudice to the appellant.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. \r\n384, 394 (1993).\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he incurred malaria while serving \r\nin the recognized guerilla forces in the Philippines during \r\nWorld War II.  He also contends that he continued to \r\nexperience recurrences of malaria and its residuals in the \r\ndecades since his service separation.\r\n\r\nService records show that, on a July 1945 \"Affidavit for \r\nPhilippine Army Personnel\", the veteran stated that he had \r\nbeen inducted in the U.S. Armed Forces in the Far East \r\n(USAFFE) in September 1941 and had served in the Philippine \r\nguerrillas from September 1942 to July 1945.  He had not \r\nsurrendered to the Japanese.  Physical examination of the \r\nveteran in July 1945 was completely normal.\r\n\r\nOn an \"Affidavit for Philippine Army Personnel\" dated in \r\nFebruary 1946, the veteran stated that he had served with the \r\nPhilippine guerrillas and fought against the Japanese from \r\nSeptember 1942 to July 1945.  He was awarded the Philippine \r\nDefense Ribbon, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, and the \r\nAsiatic Pacific Theater Medal w/1 Bronze Star.\r\n\r\nIn May 2003, the Department of the Army certified that the \r\nveteran had recognized guerilla service from November 1942 to \r\nJuly 1945 and Philippine Commonwealth Army service from July \r\n1945 to February 1946.\r\n\r\nIn a February 2004 statement, B.E.D., M.D. (Dr. B.E.D.) (- \r\ninitials used to protect privacy), this physician certified \r\nthat the veteran \"had several bouts of chilliness \r\naccompanied by fever which comes every afternoon for several \r\ndays and was relieved after taking malarial drugs which comes \r\non & off for several months and was diagnosed as malaria.\"\r\n\r\nLay statements received at the RO in September 2004 from \r\nC.A.R., A.T.P., and L.J. indicate that these men had served \r\nwith the veteran during World War II and that all of them had \r\ncontracted malaria during service.  In a lay statement \r\nreceived at the RO in October 2004, P.H.G. stated that she \r\nknew the veteran and that the veteran had contracted malaria \r\nand received treatment for this disease in 1954 and 1963.  \r\n\r\nA May 2006 liver ultrasound showed schistosomiasis of the \r\nliver.\r\n\r\nA review of the VA examination request dated in August 2006 \r\nindicates that certain medical records were tabbed by the \r\nRO/AMC for the VA examiner's review.  These records included \r\nthe veteran's July 1945 and February 1946 affidavits, the \r\nJuly 1945 physical examination report, and Dr. B.E.D.'s \r\nFebruary 2004 statement.\r\n\r\nOn VA infectious, immune, and nutritional disabilities \r\nexamination in August 2006, the veteran complained of fever, \r\nchills, and headache that had begun in 1945.  He had \r\nexperienced malaria during the war for several months and had \r\nbeen treated with anti-malarial drugs.  He had not taken any \r\nanti-malarial drugs since 1950 and his condition had been \r\nstable since that time.  The VA examiner stated that the \r\nveteran's medical records and claims file were not available \r\nbut also stated that she had reviewed private medical \r\nrecords, service medical records, and VA medical records that \r\nhad been tabbed for her review by the RO/AMC.  The VA \r\nexaminer discussed in some detail certain of the veteran's \r\npost-service private outpatient treatment records.  The \r\nveteran denied any hospitalization.  His symptoms were mild \r\nand consisted of a fever, headache, fatigue, and arthralgia.  \r\nHe also experienced chest pain and shortness of breath.  \r\n\r\nPhysical examination showed a loss of subcutaneous fat and \r\npallor that was mild, normal weight, conjunctival pallor, \r\npalmar pallor, and nail bed pallor.  The veteran's malaria \r\nwas not currently present or active.  A private blood smear \r\nfor malaria performed in May 2006 had shown no malarial \r\nparasites.  A current VA blood smear for malaria also showed \r\nno blood parasites.  The veteran's urinalysis was negative \r\nfor glucose, ketones, and protein.  The veteran's chest x-ray \r\nshowed pulmonary tuberculosis in both upper lungs.  The VA \r\nexaminer opined that it was less likely than not (less than \r\n50/50 probability) that the veteran had recurrent episodes or \r\nresiduals of malaria because there was no evidence that the \r\nveteran had malarial episodes or recurrence and his malarial \r\nsmear was negative.  She also opined that it was possible \r\nthat the veteran's reported bouts of chilliness and fever \r\nwere due to a urinary tract infection, liver parenchymal \r\ndisease, and schistosomiasis that were seen in other medical \r\nrecords.  The diagnosis was a history of malaria with no \r\nresidual evidence on this examination and a negative current \r\nmalarial smear.\r\n\r\nA September 2006 liver ultrasound showed diffuse liver \r\nparenchymal disease and did not rule out schistosomiasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if it is shown that the \r\nveteran suffers from disability resulting from an injury \r\nsuffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for \r\naggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease \r\ncontracted in line of duty, in the active military, naval, or \r\nair service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.\r\n\r\nIn addition, certain chronic diseases, including malaria, may \r\nbe presumed to have been incurred in service if they become \r\nmanifest to a compensable degree within one year of \r\nseparation from active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1110, \r\n1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309 \r\n(2006).\r\n\r\nThat an injury or disease occurred in service alone is not \r\nenough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that \r\ninjury.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic \r\ncondition during service, then a showing of continuity of \r\nsymptomatology after service is required to support a finding \r\nof chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  Service connection may \r\nalso be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to \r\nservice, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred \r\nin service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nService connection generally requires evidence of a current \r\ndisability with a relationship or connection to an injury or \r\ndisease or some other manifestation of the disability during \r\nservice.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2000); Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998) \r\n(citing Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 548 (1992)).  \r\nWhere the determinative issue involves medical causation or a \r\nmedical diagnosis, there must be competent medical evidence \r\nto the effect that the claim is plausible; lay assertions of \r\nmedical status do not constitute competent medical evidence.  \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  \r\n\r\nAlternatively, the nexus between service and the current \r\ndisability can be satisfied by medical or lay evidence of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology and medical evidence of a nexus \r\nbetween the present disability and the symptomatology.  \r\nVoerth v. West, 13 Vet. App. 117 (1999); Savage v. Gober, 10 \r\nVet. App. 488, 495 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is \r\nagainst the veteran's claim for service connection for \r\nmalaria.  There is no contemporaneously recorded medical or \r\nlaboratory evidence of malaria during active service or \r\nwithin the first post-service year, i.e., by February 1947.  \r\nIn fact, physical examination of the veteran in July 1945 was \r\ncompletely normal.  The post-service medical evidence also \r\ndoes not contain a competent opinion of a nexus between the \r\nveteran's claimed malaria and active service.  In this \r\nregard, the Board acknowledges that Dr. B.E.D. stated in \r\nFebruary 2004 that the veteran had been diagnosed with \r\nmalaria following several bouts of chilliness accompanied by \r\nfever and treated with anti-malarial drugs.  However, the \r\nphysician wrote in the past tense and did not provide \r\nspecific details as to the date(s) of the veteran's diagnosis \r\nof malaria, nor did he relate the veteran's malaria to active \r\nservice or any incident of active duty.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, after reviewing the veteran's medical records, \r\nto include Dr. B.E.D's February 2004 opinion, and \r\ncomprehensively examining the veteran, in August 2006, the VA \r\nexaminer diagnosed a history of malaria with no evidence of \r\nresiduals at that examination.  (Emphasis added.)  The VA \r\nexaminer noted that the veteran's blood smears for malaria in \r\n2005 and 2006 had shown no malarial parasites.  She found no \r\ncurrent medical evidence that the veteran had malarial \r\nepisodes or recurrences of malaria.  The VA examiner further \r\nfound that the veteran's reported bouts of chilliness and \r\nfever were possibly due to a urinary tract infection, liver \r\nparenchymal disease, and/or schistosomiasis seen in other \r\nmedical records.\r\n\r\nA service connection claim must be accompanied by evidence \r\nwhich establishes that the claimant currently has a \r\ndisability.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 144 \r\n(1992); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  \r\nIn Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the \r\nFederal Circuit held that statutes relevant to service \r\nconnection claims only permitted payment for disabilities \r\nexisting on and after the date of application for such \r\ndisorders.  The Federal Circuit also held that the structure \r\nof these statutes \"provided strong evidence of congressional \r\nintent to restrict compensation to only presently existing \r\nconditions,\" and VA's interpretation of the law requiring a \r\npresent disability for a grant of service connection was \r\nconsistent with the statutory scheme.  Degmetich, 104 F.3d at \r\n1332; see Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998) \r\n(holding VA's interpretation of the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A \r\n\ufffd 1110 to require evidence of a present disability to be \r\nconsistent with congressional intent).  Simply put, service \r\nconnection is not warranted in the absence of proof of a \r\npresent disability.\r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant that, under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.88 (2006), \r\nit is critical to recognize the nature of the disease is \r\nquestion.  Malaria, once identified by clinical and \r\nlaboratory methods, or by clinical methods alone where the \r\ndisease is endemic, is rated on the basis of the clinical \r\ncourse of the disease, the frequency and severity of \r\nrecurrences, and the necessity for and the reaction to \r\nmedication, not the presence or absence of parasites.  When \r\nthere have been relapses following the initial course of \r\ntreatment, further relapses are to be expected and for some \r\ntime the veteran must be given the benefit of the doubt as to \r\nunexplained fever of short duration, controlled by medication \r\nspecific for malaria.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the physician who reviewed the veteran's relevant \r\ntreatment records, to include B.E.D's February 2004 \r\nassessment, examined the veteran and considered pertinent \r\nlaboratory studies unequivocally concluded that there was no \r\ncurrent medical evidence that the veteran had malarial \r\nepisodes or recurrences of malaria. \r\nAs to the question of whether there is a current diagnosis of \r\nmalaria, to include recurrent episodes or residuals of \r\nmalaria, the more recent medical opinion is of greater \r\nprobative value.  See Boggs v. West, 11 Vet. App. 334, 344 \r\n(1998). \r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, the Board finds that there is no \r\nmedical evidence of malaria until decades post-service; the \r\npreponderance of the competent evidence is against a nexus \r\nbetween post-service malaria and service; and the \r\npreponderance of the medical evidence is also against a \r\ncurrent diagnosis of malaria, to include recurrent episodes \r\nor residuals of malaria.\r\n\r\nAs to the lay assertions of malaria during or proximate to \r\nservice and of a causal link between his claimed malaria and \r\nservice, it is well established that lay persons are not \r\ncompetent to opine on medical matters such as diagnoses or \r\netiology of medical disorders.  While one can describe \r\nsymptoms of malaria, the lay statements submitted in support \r\nof the veteran's claim are entitled to no probative value in \r\nestablishing a nexus between a current diagnosis of malaria \r\nand service.  (Emphasis added.)  See Cromley v. Brown, 7 Vet. \r\nApp. 376, 379 (1995); Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, \r\n494-95 (1992).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the veteran's claim for service \r\nconnection for malaria, to include recurrent episodes or \r\nresiduals of malaria.  In making this determination, the \r\nBoard has considered the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b), \r\nbut there is not such a state of approximate balance of the \r\npositive evidence with the negative evidence to otherwise \r\nwarrant a favorable decision.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. \r\nApp. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2001).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for malaria, to include \r\nrecurrent episodes or residuals of malaria, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nR.

Cieplak, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from April 1986 to \r\nMay 2000.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arises \r\nfrom a January 2004 decision of a Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Huntington, West Virginia, Regional Office (RO), \r\nthat denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and \r\nCTS.\r\n\r\nIn May 2006, the Board remanded this matter to the RO to \r\nafford due process and for other development.  Following its \r\ncompletion of the Board's requested actions, the RO awarded \r\nentitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, \r\nand that issue is no longer in appellate status.  The RO \r\ncontinued the denial of the veteran's claim for entitlement \r\nto service connection for  CTS (as reflected in a June 2007 \r\nsupplemental SOC (SSOC)) and returned this matter to the \r\nBoard for further appellate consideration.   \r\n\r\nA hearing was held at the RO in November 2005 before a \r\nVeterans Law Judge who is no longer employed by the Board.  A \r\ntranscript of the hearing is of record.  The Board wrote the \r\nveteran and his representative in October 2007 to inquire as \r\nto whether he wanted another hearing before a different \r\nVeterans Law Judge.  Telephone numbers were also provided.  \r\nNeither the veteran nor his representative has responded to \r\nthat inquiry. The Board concludes, therefore, that the \r\nveteran does not desire an additional personal hearing before \r\nthe Board. \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All notification and development action needed to fairly \r\nadjudicate the claim on appeal has been accomplished. \r\n\r\n2.  CTS was not demonstrated during the veteran's service, \r\nand a preponderance of the competent evidence of record is \r\nagainst concluding that such disorder was caused or \r\naggravated by service or a service connected disorder. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nBilateral carpal tunnel disorder was not incurred or \r\naggravated by active military service or to a service \r\nconnected disorder, nor may it be presumed to have been so \r\nincurred.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 5102, \r\n5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2007).    \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), codified at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, \r\n3.326(a), and as interpreted by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) have been fulfilled \r\nby information provided to the veteran in letters from the RO \r\ndated in August 2003, May 2006 and September 2006.  Those \r\nletters notified the veteran of VA's responsibilities in \r\nobtaining information to assist the veteran in completing his \r\nclaim, identified the veteran's duties in obtaining \r\ninformation and evidence to substantiate his claim, and \r\nrequested that the veteran send in any evidence in his \r\npossession that would support his claim.  (See 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a)), Quartuccio v. Principi, \r\n16 Vet. App. 183 (2002), Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. \r\n112 (2004).  See also Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n103, 110 (2005), reversed on other grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2006), Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006); Mayfield v. Nicholson (Mayfield II), 20 Vet. App. \r\n537 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe veteran has been made aware of the information and \r\nevidence necessary to substantiate his claim and has been \r\nprovided opportunities to submit such evidence.  The RO has \r\nproperly processed the appeal following the issuance of the \r\nrequired notice.  Moreover, all pertinent development has \r\nbeen undertaken, examinations have been performed, and all \r\navailable evidence has been obtained in this case.  The \r\nappellant has not identified any additional evidence that \r\ncould be obtained to substantiate the claim.  Clearly, from \r\nsubmissions by and on behalf of the veteran, he is fully \r\nconversant with the legal requirements in this case.  Thus, \r\nthe content of these letters complied with the requirements \r\nof 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b).  No \r\nfurther action is necessary for compliance with the VCAA.   \r\n\r\nLaw and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disorder that was \r\nincurred or aggravated while on active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131.  Disability which is proximately due to or the \r\nresult of a service-connected disease or injury may also be \r\nservice connected.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310.  \"A determination of \r\nservice connection requires a finding of the existence of a \r\ncurrent disability and a determination of a relationship \r\nbetween that disability and an injury or disease incurred in \r\nservice.\"  Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993).  \r\nAdditionally, service connection may be granted for any \r\ndisease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Each \r\ndisorder for which a veteran seeks service connection must be \r\nconsidered on the basis of evidence, including that shown by \r\nhis service records, his medical records, and pertinent \r\nmedical and lay evidence.  Id. \r\n\r\nIn a claim for service connection, the ultimate credibility \r\nor weight to be accorded evidence must be determined as a \r\nquestion of fact.  The Board determines whether (1) the \r\nweight of the evidence supports the claim, or (2) the weight \r\nof the \"positive\" evidence in favor of the claim is in \r\nrelative balance with the weight of the \"negative\" evidence \r\nagainst the claim: the appellant prevails in either event.  \r\nHowever, if the weight of the evidence is against the \r\nappellant's claim, the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102;  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. \r\nApp. 49 (1990). \r\n\r\nFactual Background and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that he developed bilateral CTS during \r\nservice. He asserts that he experienced tingling and numbness \r\nof the shoulders, forearms and hands, and maintains that \r\nthese upper extremity symptoms have persisted during post \r\nservice years as a manifestation of CTS.\r\n\r\nService treatment records dated in March 1999 noted \r\ncomplaints of posterior neck pain.  Physical examination \r\nrevealed tenderness to palpation by the midline, X-ray reveal \r\na possible herniated nucleus pulposus to C5-6, which was \r\nconfirmed in April 1999.  Cervical traction was provided.  \r\nMay 1999 reflect that the veteran was seen for complaints of \r\nsevere neck pain with tingling numbness in either hand or \r\narm.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine \r\nat that time revealed a small right C5-6 osteophyte/bulging \r\ndisc.  It was noted that these finding explained decreased \r\nbiceps reflexes, but did not explain his pain syndrome well \r\nand that there was no clear explanation for the transient \r\nmorning hand numbness.  Service connection has been \r\nestablished for cervical disc disease with history of neck \r\nsprains.  The Board notes that the veteran had symptoms \r\nduring service involving the right shoulder that were \r\nattributed to right shoulder impingement syndrome, a \r\ncondition for which service connection has been established.\r\n\r\nThe veteran underwent a VA medical examination in July 2000.  \r\nNeurological evaluation revealed no signs or symptoms of CTS \r\nof either upper extremity.\r\n\r\nBilateral CTS was first objectively identified by \r\nelectrodiagnostic testing in June 2003, a few years after the \r\nveteran had left military service.  There is no medical \r\nopinion in the record attributing CTS to any event or \r\noccurrence of the veteran's military service.\r\n\r\nA VA orthopedic examination was performed in November 2003.  \r\nThe veteran complained of paresthesias of both hands and loss \r\nof neck motion.  The assessment was herniated disc in the \r\ncervical spine at C5-6, with central canal stenosis and CTS.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Board's May 2006 Remand, the veteran was \r\nafforded another VA examination in October 2006.  The \r\nexaminer reviewed the claims file, including service \r\ntreatment records, and conducted a physical examination of \r\nthe veteran.  The physician explained the etiology of CTS as \r\nbeing the compression of the median nerve between the carpal \r\nligaments and other structures within the carpal tunnel \r\n\"entrapment neuropathy.\"  He explained that CTS and \r\ncervical spine disease were two different diseases.  The \r\nexaminer concluded that the veteran's CTS was unrelated to \r\nthe veteran's service connected cervical disorder and that it \r\nwould be speculative to conclude that the veteran's \r\nsymptomatology in service was a manifestation of the claimed \r\ndisorder.  \r\n\r\nWhere a determinative issue involves medical causation or a \r\nmedical diagnosis, competent medical evidence is required.  \r\nGrottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  Although the \r\nappellant is competent to provide evidence of visible \r\nsymptoms, he is not competent to provide evidence that \r\nrequires medical knowledge.  Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 492 (1992).\r\n\r\nAfter consideration of all of the evidence, the Board finds \r\nthat the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for bilateral CTS is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nREN\ufffdE M.

Gunn, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from August 1983 to June \r\n1986.  \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a May 2004 rating decision of the Seattle, \r\nWashington, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO), which determined that new and material evidence \r\nhad been submitted to reopen the veteran's claim of service \r\nconnection for a right side jaw condition, residual of \r\ninfection and dental surgery, previously claimed as residuals \r\nof tooth trauma.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2006, the veteran testified at a personal hearing \r\nbefore a Decision Review Officer (DRO).  A copy of the \r\ntranscript is of record.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2008, the veteran testified at a personal hearing \r\nbefore the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A copy of the \r\ntranscript is of record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  Service connection for a right side jaw condition, to \r\ninclude residuals of an infection and dental surgery was \r\ndenied in an October 2000 rating decision.  The veteran was \r\nnotified of this decision and of his appeal rights.  He did \r\nnot appeal the decision.  \r\n\r\n2.  Since the October 2000 rating decision which denied \r\nservice connection for a right side jaw condition, to include \r\nresiduals of an infection and dental surgery, evidence that \r\nrelates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim has not been presented or secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe October 2000 rating decision, which denied entitlement to \r\nservice connection for right side jaw condition, to include \r\nresiduals of an infection and dental surgery, is final, and \r\nevidence received since that decision is not new and \r\nmaterial.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5108, 7105 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.156(a), 20.1103 (2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Applicable Laws and Regulations\r\nA.  New and Material\r\n\r\nPursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7105(c), a decision by the RO may \r\nnot thereafter be reopened and allowed and a claim based upon \r\nthe same factual basis may not be considered.  The exception \r\nto this rule is described under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5108, which \r\nprovides that \"[i]f new and material evidence is presented \r\nor secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, \r\nthe [Board] shall reopen the claim and review the former \r\ndisposition of the claim.\"  Therefore, once a rating \r\ndecision has been issued, absent the submission of new and \r\nmaterial evidence, the claim cannot be reopened or \r\nadjudicated by VA.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5108, 7105(c); Jackson v. \r\nPrincipi, 265 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Barnett v. Brown, \r\n83 F.3d 1380, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  \r\n\r\nNew evidence is defined as existing evidence not previously \r\nsubmitted to agency decision makers.  Material evidence is \r\ndefined as existing evidence that, by itself or when \r\nconsidered with previous evidence of record, relates to an \r\nunestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  New \r\nand material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant \r\nof the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final \r\ndenial of the claim sought to be reopened, and must raise a \r\nreasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a).  \r\n\r\nWhen determining whether a claim should be reopened, the \r\ncredibility of the newly submitted evidence is presumed.  \r\nJustus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510 (1992).  Additionally, \r\nwhen determining whether the veteran has submitted new and \r\nmaterial evidence to reopen a claim, consideration must be \r\ngiven to all the evidence since the last final denial of the \r\nclaim.  Evans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273 (1996).  In Evans, \r\nthe United States Court of Appeals for Veteran Claims (Court) \r\nindicated that the newly presented evidence need not be \r\nprobative of all the elements required to award the claim, \r\nbut need only tend to prove each element that was a specified \r\nbasis for the last disallowance.  Id. at 284.  \r\n\r\nB.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110.  Service connection may be granted for \r\nany disease diagnosed after service when all the evidence \r\nestablishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  To prevail on the issue of service \r\nconnection, there must be medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, \r\nlay evidence of in-service injury or disease; and medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or \r\ninjury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe chronicity provision of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) is \r\napplicable where the evidence, regardless of its date, shows \r\nthat the veteran had a chronic condition in service or during \r\nan applicable presumptive period and still has such \r\ncondition.  Such evidence must be medical unless it relates \r\nto a condition as to which, under the Court's case law, lay \r\nobservation is competent.  Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, \r\n498 (1997).  In addition, if a condition noted during service \r\nis not shown to be chronic, then generally a showing of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology after service is required for \r\nservice connection.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nUnder current VA regulations, compensation is only available \r\nfor certain types of dental and oral conditions listed under \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.150, such as impairment of the mandible, loss \r\nof a portion of the ramus, and loss of a portion of the \r\nmaxilla.  Compensation is available for loss of teeth only if \r\nsuch is due to loss of substance of body of maxilla or \r\nmandible.  Otherwise, a veteran may be entitled to service \r\nconnection for dental conditions including treatable carious \r\nteeth, replaceable missing teeth, dental or alveolar \r\nabscesses, and periodontal disease, for the sole purpose of \r\nreceiving VA outpatient dental services and treatment, if \r\ncertain criteria are met.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1712; 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 3.381, 17.161.  \r\n\r\nII.  Decision  \r\n\r\nAt the time of the October 2000 rating decision, which denied \r\nservice connection for residuals of tooth trauma, the \r\nevidence of record consisted of the veteran's service \r\ntreatment records, VA outpatient treatment records from July \r\n1999 to April 2000, and the veteran's application for \r\ncompensation benefits.  The RO noted that the veteran had \r\nfour teeth extracted during his military service in January \r\n1986, which resulted in swelling on the right side of his \r\nface with purulent intraoral extrudate in the area of one of \r\nthe extracted teeth.  The veteran was hospitalized for \r\nfourteen days thereafter, during which time, an incision, \r\ndrainage of the fascia planes on the right side of the face, \r\nand placement of drains were performed.  Upon discharge from \r\nservice, the veteran reported on his April 1986 report of \r\nmedical history has having or had severe tooth or gum \r\ntrouble, and the physician noted that the veteran bled for \r\nfour to five days after his wisdom teeth were extracted.  An \r\nApril 1986 separation examination noted no dental \r\nabnormalities.  The RO determined that since there was no \r\nrecord trauma of the teeth and because extractions of the \r\nteeth are not considered a loss of bone through trauma or \r\ndisease, service connection must be denied because a loss \r\nresulting from an extraction of the tooth is not considered a \r\ndisability under VA law.  The veteran was notified of the \r\ndenial in November 2000, including his appeal rights, and he \r\ndid not appeal the decision.  Thus, it is final.  See 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1103.\r\n\r\nDuring the May 2008 hearing, the veteran testified that he \r\nhad four wisdom teeth removed during his military service, \r\nand two days later, he incurred a 106 degree temperature \r\nalong with a swollen jaw.  He explained that surgery was \r\nperformed, and he was hospitalized for two weeks due to his \r\njaw problems.  Since discharge from service, the veteran \r\nstated that he has difficulty chewing and has pain on the \r\nright side of his jaw and back tooth.  He contends that \r\nservice connection is warranted for his right side jaw \r\ncondition, to include residuals of an infection and dental \r\nsurgery.  \r\n\r\nBased upon the evidence of record, the Board finds that the \r\nveteran has not presented evidence since the October 2000 \r\nrating decision which raises a reasonable possibility of \r\nsubstantiating the claim of service connection for a right \r\nside jaw condition, to include residuals of an infection and \r\ndental surgery.  Since the October 2000 rating decision, the \r\nevidence received into the record includes VA outpatient \r\ntreatment records from November 2000 to March 2008 and June \r\n2007 examination results from a contract dental examination \r\nperformed by QTC Medical Services (QTC).  \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records note the veteran's \r\n\"jaw/dental surgery\" during service as past medical history \r\nand also list \"dental carries, unspecified\" under the \r\nveteran's problem list.  In a February 1999 VA outpatient \r\ntreatment note, dental pain was reported by the veteran, and \r\nhe was given Ibuprofen.  Thereafter, a November 2000 VA \r\noutpatient treatment note reports that the veteran was seen \r\nfor an abscessed tooth.  He exhibited purulent drainage from \r\nthe right buccal gingival, back.  He was diagnosed with \r\ndental abscess, prescribed Amoxicillin, and requested to \r\nfollow-up with a local clinic.  Finally, in December 2002, \r\nthe veteran stated that he hoped the VA physician could \r\n\"make an addendum to [his] DD 214 showing [his] nerve \r\nproblems from the wisdom teeth extraction.\"  No reference is \r\nmade in the VA outpatient treatment records as to whether the \r\nveteran has a current right jaw disability that is \r\nattributable to his wisdom teeth procedure during his \r\nmilitary service.  Similarly, during the May 2007 QTC \r\nexamination, the examiner noted that examination of the \r\nmandible and maxilla were normal, and the ramus and palates \r\nrevealed no abnormal findings.  The examiner determined that \r\nthere was no pathology to render a diagnosis for a right side \r\njaw condition or status post infection from dental surgery.  \r\nHe further added that his final diagnosis is \"no current \r\nright side jaw condition and no current conditions resulting \r\nf[rom] the post infection from surgery.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the evidence submitted in connection with his claim is \r\nnew, in that it was not previously of record, it is not \r\nmaterial, as it does not show that the veteran has a current \r\ndisability due to his in-service dental surgery.  Although \r\nthe VA outpatient treatment records note periodic complaints \r\nof dental problems, the records do not specifically indicate \r\na current dental disability due to service.  The Court has \r\nheld that additional evidence, which consists merely of \r\nrecords of post-service treatment that do not indicate that a \r\ncondition is service-connected, is not new and material.  Cox \r\nv. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 95, 99 (1993).  In addition, the VA \r\nexaminer concluded during the June 2007 QTC examination that \r\nthere was no current right side jaw condition and no current \r\ndental conditions resulting from the in-service dental \r\nsurgery and post infection.  Clearly, this opinion is adverse \r\nto the veteran's claim, and such adverse evidence cannot be \r\nused to reopen a claim.  The Court has held that evidence \r\nwhich is unfavorable to the veteran's case may not \"trigger \r\na reopening\" of the claim.  See Villalobos v. Principi, 3 \r\nVet. App. 450, 452 (1992).  The Board concludes that this \r\ninformation, while new, does not raise a reasonable \r\npossibility of substantiating the veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\nWe do not doubt that the veteran sincerely believes such a \r\nrelationship exists, but he is not competent, as a layperson, \r\nto render an opinion as to medical causation.  Therefore, he \r\nis not competent to refute the objective opinion of the VA \r\nexaminer.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 \r\n(1992).  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons and bases set forth above, the Board finds \r\nthat the evidence received in conjunction with the claim to \r\nreopen is not new and material, and does not serve to reopen \r\nthe claim for service connection for a right side jaw \r\ncondition, to include residuals of an infection and dental \r\nsurgery.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5108, 7105; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a).  \r\nHaving found that the evidence is not new and material, no \r\nfurther adjudication of this claim is warranted.  See \r\nKehoskie v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 31 (1991).  \r\n\r\nIII.  Duty to Notify & Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) imposes \r\nobligations on VA in terms of its duty to notify and assist \r\nclaimants.  When VA receives a complete or substantially \r\ncomplete application for benefits, it is required to notify \r\nthe claimant and the representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(b) (2007); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 \r\n(2002).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the VCAA notice requirements have been \r\nsatisfied by the February 2004 letter sent to the veteran.  \r\nIn the letter, the veteran was informed that in order to \r\nsubstantiate a claim for service connection, the evidence \r\nneeded to show he had a current disability, a disease or \r\ninjury in service, and evidence of a nexus between the post-\r\nservice disability and the disease or injury in service, \r\nwhich was usually shown by medical records or medical \r\nopinions.  See also the May 2007 and October 2007 VCAA \r\nletters.  \r\n\r\nAs to informing the veteran of which information and evidence \r\nhe was to provide to VA and which information and evidence VA \r\nwould attempt to obtain on his behalf, VA informed him it had \r\na duty to obtain any records held by any federal agency.  It \r\nalso informed him that on his behalf, VA would make \r\nreasonable efforts to obtain records that were not held by a \r\nfederal agency, such as records from private doctors and \r\nhospitals.  The letter stated that he would need to give VA \r\nenough information about the records so that it could obtain \r\nthem for him.  Finally, he was told to submit any evidence in \r\nhis possession that pertained to the claim.  \r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, on March 31, 2006, the \r\nCourt issued a decision in the appeal of Kent v. Nicholson, \r\n20 Vet. App. 1 (2006), which establishes new requirements \r\nregarding the VCAA notice and reopening claims.  The Court \r\nheld that the VCAA notice must include the bases for the \r\ndenial in the prior decision and VA must respond with a \r\nnotice letter that describes what evidence would be necessary \r\nto substantiate that element or elements required to \r\nestablish service connection that were found insufficient in \r\nthe previous denial.  Id.  The question of what constitutes \r\nmaterial evidence to reopen a claim for service connection \r\ndepends on the basis on which the prior claim was denied.  \r\nSee Evans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273, 283 (1996) (holding \r\nevidence is material if it is relevant to and probative of an \r\nissue that was a specified basis for the last final \r\ndisallowance).  The veteran has been apprised of the \r\ninformation necessary to reopen his claim for service \r\nconnection a right side jaw condition, to include residuals \r\nof an infection and dental surgery by way of the February \r\n2004 VCAA letter.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet.App. 473 \r\n(2006) notice, the Board notes that since new and material \r\nevidence has not been presented to reopen the claim, service \r\nconnection cannot be established.  Thus, any questions with \r\nregard to a disability rating or effective date is moot.  See \r\nalso VCAA letters dated in May and October 2007.\r\n\r\nVA must also make reasonable efforts to assist the claimant \r\nin obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claim for \r\nthe benefit sought, unless no reasonable possibility exists \r\nthat such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2007).  In connection \r\nwith the current appeal, VA obtained the veteran's service \r\ntreatment records, VA outpatient treatment records from \r\nFebruary 1999 to March 2008, and Social Security \r\nAdministration (SSA) medical records.  The veteran was also \r\nprovided an examination in connection with his claim.  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that all \r\nreasonable efforts were made by VA to obtain evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  The evidence of record \r\nprovides sufficient information to adequately evaluate the \r\nclaim.  Therefore, no further assistance to the veteran with \r\nthe development of evidence is required, nor is there notice \r\ndelay or deficiency resulting in any prejudice to the \r\nveteran.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(d); \r\nsee Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on \r\nother grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence not having been presented, the \r\napplication to reopen a claim of service connection for a \r\nright side jaw condition, to include residuals of an \r\ninfection and dental surgery is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nC.

The veteran served in the United States Navy as a \r\nfireman, and was exposed to asbestos in service.  \r\n\r\n2.  The claims folder includes current diagnoses of chronic \r\nobstructive pulmonary disease and bronchitis.  \r\n\r\n3.  There is no competent medical evidence in the claims \r\nfolder which links the veteran's currently diagnosed lung \r\ndisorders to service, including the veteran's exposure to \r\nasbestos in service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\nA lung disorder was not incurred or aggravated in service; \r\nand the service incurrence of a lung disorder may not be \r\npresumed.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2007).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete, or substantially complete, \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) (2007).  By \r\nletters dated in January 2005, January and April 2006, the RO \r\nsatisfied VA's notice requirements such that a reasonable \r\nperson could be expected to understand what was needed to \r\nsubstantiate his claim, and thus the essential fairness of \r\nthe adjudication was not frustrated.  Accordingly, the Board \r\nconcludes that, even assuming a notice error, that error was \r\nharmless.  See Medrano v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 165 (2007); \r\nMayfield v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 537, 543 (2006).\r\n\r\nWith respect to VA's duty to assist, the Board notes that the \r\navailable records from the sources identified by the veteran, \r\nand for which he authorized VA to request, have been \r\nassociated with the claims folder.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A.    \r\n\r\nThe veteran's representative contends the veteran should be \r\nafforded a VA examination.  The regulations provide that VA \r\nwill obtain a medical opinion when the evidence of record \r\ndoes not contain sufficient medical evidence to decide the \r\nclaim if there is competent medical evidence of a current \r\ndiagnosed disability, the evidence establishes the veteran \r\nsuffered an event, disease of symptoms of a disease in \r\nservice and there are indications the claimed disability may \r\nbe associated with the event or injury in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.159(c)(4) (2007).  In this case, while the Board finds it \r\ncredible that the veteran was exposed to asbestos in service, \r\nand there are current diagnosed lung disorders, there is no \r\nindication in the record that the currently diagnosed lung \r\ndisorders may be associated with exposure to asbestos in \r\nservice.  The veteran has submitted an article from the \r\nAmerican Lung Association about the development of \r\nasbestosis.  The veteran's current lung disorders have not \r\nbeen diagnosed as asbestosis.  In addition, the Veterans \r\nBenefits Administration Adjudication Procedure Manual (M21-\r\n1MR), Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2. includes a list of \r\ndisorders that can be produced by inhalation of asbestos \r\nfibers.  The claims folder does not include any evidence \r\ndemonstrating the veteran has developed any of those \r\ndisorders.  The veteran has not presented any evidence which \r\nindicates a link between his current lung disorders and \r\nservice other than his own statements.  The Board has also \r\nnoted there is no medical evidence of treatment or diagnosis \r\nof any lung disorder in service or for many years thereafter.  \r\nThe veteran's private physician noted the veteran's chronic \r\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is related to smoking.  \r\nA 50 year history of smoking one pack a day has been \r\nrepeatedly documented in the medical records.  VA is not \r\nrequired to provide an examination in these circumstances.  \r\n\r\nAs such, the Board finds that there is no further action to \r\nbe undertaken to comply with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a), \ufffd 5103A, or 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159, and that the \r\nveteran will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board's \r\nadjudication of his claims.  \r\n\r\nRelevant Laws and Regulations.  To establish service \r\nconnection for a claimed disability, the facts as shown by \r\nevidence must demonstrate that a particular disease or injury \r\nresulting in current disability was incurred during active \r\nservice or, if preexisting active service, was aggravated \r\ntherein.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002).  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis \r\nfor certain chronic disabilities, including bronchiectasis, \r\nwhen they are manifested to a compensable degree within the \r\ninitial post service year.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, \r\n1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309 (2007).  \r\n\r\nFactual Background and Analysis.  Service personnel records \r\nindicate the veteran served in the United States Navy, aboard \r\nthe USS Warwick (AKA-89) as a Fireman.   \r\n\r\nThe service medical records do not include any diagnoses or \r\ntreatment for a lung disorder.  His lungs were noted to be \r\nnormal at service entrance and service separation.  His chest \r\nX-rays were normal.  \r\n\r\nThere are no medical records documenting that the veteran had \r\nany lung disorder within one year of his separation from the \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nPrivate medical records dated from 1996 to 2000 indicate the \r\nveteran was treated for a bronchial cough.  He had upper \r\nrespiratory infections, bronchitis and chronic obstructive \r\npulmonary disease (COPD) was diagnosed.  In June 1996, it was \r\nrecorded that the veteran had smoked one pack a day for fifty \r\nyears.  September 1998 records reveal the veteran had smoked \r\nfor 50 pack years, and in February and March 2000 he was \r\ntreated for bronchitis.  August 2002 records from the \r\nveteran's private physician specifically note the veteran has \r\na history of COPD secondary to smoking.  \r\n\r\nVA X-rays taken in September 2003 found no evidence of active \r\ndisease, COPD or malignancy.  Subsequently, July 2004 VA X-\r\nrays revealed COPD and old granulomatous disease.  That \r\nreport noted a questionable clinical history of \"asbestosis \r\nexposure,\" but there was no diagnosis of asbestosis nor any \r\nnotations there were findings related to exposure to \r\nasbestos.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran submitted statements from his friends and family \r\ndescribing his current limitations, walking, breathing, and \r\nstanding, and in a November 2005 statement he indicated he \r\nhad been exposed to asbestos while working in the boiler \r\nroom, with pipes and insulation aboard the USS Warwick.  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for the claimed \r\ndisorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current \r\ndisability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay \r\nevidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease \r\nor injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 \r\n(1999).  The determination as to whether these requirements \r\nare met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record \r\nand the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. \r\nSee Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe claims folder includes medical records demonstrating the \r\nveteran currently has a lung disorder, COPD and has been \r\ntreated for bronchitis on several occasions, which provides \r\nevidence or element number one.  There is also evidence \r\ndemonstrating the veteran was exposed to asbestos in service, \r\nwhich is evidence of an event in service.  VA has recognized \r\nthat U.S. Navy veterans of World War II were exposed to \r\nasbestos in service since it was used extensively in the \r\nconstruction of military ships.  See Veterans Benefits \r\nAdministration Adjudication Procedure Manual (M21-1MR), Part \r\nIV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2.  The veteran's statements as to \r\nhis exposure to asbestos in service are consistent with the \r\nnature and circumstances of his service.  His claim that he \r\nwas exposed to asbestos in service is credible.   \r\n\r\nThe evidence missing in this case, is competent medical \r\nevidence linking the currently diagnosed COPD to service or \r\nto exposure to asbestos, as required by element three.  The \r\nonly evidence linking his current lung disorder to service \r\nare the statements of the veteran.  While the veteran is \r\ncompetent to describe his symptoms and to recall his exposure \r\nto asbestos in service, he is does not have the requisite \r\ntraining, education or experience to make a medical diagnosis \r\nor to relate a medical disorder to a specific cause.  See \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  In \r\naddition, the veteran's private physician has clearly \r\nindicated his COPD is secondary to his 50 year, pack a day \r\nsmoking history.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran does not claim and there is no evidence of a lung \r\ndisorder in service or for many years thereafter.  In the \r\nabsence of competent medical evidence linking the veteran's \r\ncurrently diagnosed lung disorders to service, service \r\nconnection is not warranted.  The preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claim for service connection for a \r\nlung disorder.  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a lung disorder, claimed as due to \r\nexposure to asbestos in service, is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL E.

Ishizawar, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a veteran who served on active duty from \r\nAugust 1996 to August 2000.  This matter is before the Board \r\nof Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2003 \r\nrating decision of the Los Angeles, California Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, in pertinent \r\npart, denied service connection for a right ankle disability.  \r\nAt the veteran's request, a Travel Board hearing was \r\nscheduled for February 9, 2006; he failed to appear.  In \r\nDecember 2006, the case was remanded for additional \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThere is no competent evidence of a current right ankle \r\ndisability or any residuals from the right ankle injury \r\ntreated during service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nService connection for a right ankle disability is not \r\nwarranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1110, 5107 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, (2007). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nA.\tVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist \r\nclaimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  See \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  The VCAA \r\napplies to the instant claim.  Upon receipt of a complete or \r\nsubstantially complete application for benefits, VA is \r\nrequired to notify the claimant and his representative of any \r\ninformation, and any medical or lay evidence, that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. \r\n183 (2002).  Proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of \r\nany information and evidence not of record (1) that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to \r\nprovide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1) (including as amended effective May \r\n30, 2008; 73 Fed. Reg. 84, 23353 (April 30, 2008)).  VCAA \r\nnotice should be provided to a claimant before the initial \r\nunfavorable agency of original jurisdiction decision on a \r\nclaim.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe veteran was advised of VA's duties to notify and assist \r\nin the development of his claim prior to its initial \r\nadjudication.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. \r\nCir. 2006).  January 2002 and January 2007 letters explained \r\nthe evidence necessary to substantiate his claim, the \r\nevidence VA was responsible for providing, and the evidence \r\nhe was responsible for providing.  He has had ample \r\nopportunity to respond/supplement the record, and is not \r\nprejudiced by any technical notice deficiency (including in \r\ntiming) that may have occurred earlier in the process.  In \r\ncompliance with Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006), the January 2007 letter informed the veteran of \r\ndisability rating and effective date criteria.  The claim was \r\nreadjudicated after all critical notice was issued, and \r\ndevelopment sought by the Board was completed.  See March \r\n2008 Supplemental Statement of the Case.  The veteran is not \r\nprejudiced by this process, and it is not alleged otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe veteran's service medical records (SMRs) are associated \r\nwith his claims file, and pertinent treatment records have \r\nbeen secured.  The RO arranged for a VA examination in \r\nNovember 2007.  The veteran has not identified any pertinent \r\nevidence that remains outstanding.  VA's duty to assist is \r\nmet.  Accordingly, the Board will address the merits of the \r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nB.\tFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe veteran's SMRs reveal that in June 1998, he injured his \r\nright foot while working on a flight line.  He complained of \r\nswelling, discoloration, and pain.  On examination by the \r\nphysician, the veteran denied pain or problems with \r\nambulation.  The physician found no edema, bone tenderness, \r\ndeformity, or discoloration.  Contusion of the lower \r\nextremity was diagnosed.  The veteran was discharged on \r\nMotrin, with recommendations of ice and elevation, and \r\ninstructions to return if symptoms worsened or there was \r\nsignificant swelling.  Several weeks later, also in June \r\n1998, the veteran twisted his right ankle while playing \r\nbasketball.  On physical examination, minimal edema of the \r\nlateral malleolus and tenderness of the anterior talofibular \r\nligament were noted; there was no bone tenderness.  Ankle \r\nsprain/strain was diagnosed, and the veteran was discharged \r\non Motrin with recommendations of ice and elevation.  \r\nSubsequent SMRs are silent for any complaints, findings, \r\ntreatment, or diagnosis relating to a right ankle disability.  \r\nThe veteran was not afforded a separation physical \r\nexamination; however, in a June 2000 health assessment \r\ncompleted two months prior to his separation from service, he \r\ndid not report any residual right ankle or right foot \r\nproblems. \r\n\r\nVA outpatient treatment records from November 2000 to \r\nSeptember 2002 are silent for complaints, findings, \r\ntreatment, or diagnosis relating to a right ankle disability.\r\n\r\nIn his May 2004 VA Form 9, substantive appeal, the veteran \r\nnoted that his denial of service connection for a right ankle \r\ndisability was based on \"the lack of current diagnosis or \r\ntreatment without current pathology,\" and contended that \r\n\"pain is a pathology although subjective.\"  He also stated \r\nthat he continues to have pain in his ankle, which he treats \r\nwith over-the-counter medications, elevation, and rest.  \r\n\r\nOn November 2007 VA examination, the veteran reported \r\ninjuring his right ankle in service and subsequently \r\nexperiencing on and off right ankle pain and dysfunction, \r\nwith the occasional need to take Ibuprofen for pain relief.  \r\nOn physical examination, there was no deformity, only mild \r\ntenderness over the lateral malleolus.  The veteran's right \r\nfoot was within normal limits, and he walked with a normal \r\ngait and no limping.  The ankle had a full range of motion \r\nwith dorsiflexion to 10 degrees and plantar flexion to 40 \r\ndegrees.  The examiner stated that his physical examination \r\nof the right ankle showed \"no significant findings except \r\nintermittent pain but not disabling pain.\"  X-rays showed no \r\nsignificant bone or joint abnormality, though there was \r\nminimal ligamental calcification adjacent to the tip of the \r\nlateral malleolus.  History of right ankle strain was \r\ndiagnosed.  Based upon his review of the claims file and \r\nexamination of the veteran, the examiner opined that there \r\nwere no significant physical or radiological findings of a \r\ncurrent or residual disability of the right ankle.\r\n\r\nIn a July 2008 post-remand brief, the veteran's \r\nrepresentative argued that the November 2007 VA examination \r\nwas incomplete as it did not provide an opinion as to the \r\nseverity of the veteran's right ankle disability, nor did the \r\nexaminer discuss its etiology (whether the disability was \r\nrelated to the veteran's military service).\r\n\r\nC.\tLegal Criteria and Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability due to \r\ndisease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  \r\nService connection also may be granted for any disease \r\ninitially diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, \r\nincluding that pertinent to service, establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nTo prevail on the issue of service connection, there must be \r\nmedical evidence of a current disability; medical or, in \r\ncertain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence \r\nor aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical evidence \r\nof a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury \r\nand the present disease or injury.  See Hickson v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 247 (1999).  The determination as to whether these \r\nrequirements are met is based on an analysis of all the \r\nevidence of record and an evaluation of its credibility and \r\nprobative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nA disorder also may be service connected if the evidence of \r\nrecord shows that the veteran currently has a disorder that \r\nwas chronic in service or, if not chronic, that was seen in \r\nservice with continuity of symptomatology demonstrated \r\nthereafter.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  A demonstration of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology is an alternative method of \r\ndemonstrating the second and/or third elements discussed \r\nabove.  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-96 (1997).\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative \r\nevidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. \r\n 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.  When all of the \r\nevidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining \r\nwhether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative \r\nequipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or \r\nwhether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nclaim, in which case the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990). \r\n\r\nIt is not in dispute that the veteran injured his right ankle \r\nin service and received treatment for such injury.  The next \r\nthreshold matter that must be addressed is whether he has (or \r\nat any time during the appeal period had) a chronic right \r\nankle disability that is a residual of such injury.\r\n\r\nThe record does not include any competent evidence of a \r\ndiagnosis of a right ankle disability.  After the veteran's \r\nJune 1998 right foot and right ankle injuries, subsequent \r\nSMRs, including a June 2000 health assessment report, were \r\nsilent for any complaints, findings, treatment, or diagnosis \r\nrelating to a right ankle disability.  Postservice treatment \r\nrecords, consisting of VA outpatient treatment records from \r\nNovember 2000 to September 2002, are also silent for \r\ncomplaints, findings, treatment, or diagnosis relating to a \r\nright ankle disability.\r\n\r\nVA attempted to assist the veteran in establishing his claim \r\nby arranging for the veteran to be examined to determine the \r\npresence and etiology of a right ankle disability.  The \r\nNovember 2007 VA examination did not find any significant \r\nphysical or radiological findings of a current or residual \r\ndisability of the right ankle.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's own statements stating that he has a right \r\nankle disability and that it is related to his service are \r\nnot competent evidence, as he is a layperson, and lacks the \r\ntraining to opine regarding medical diagnosis and etiology.  \r\nSee Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 495 (1992).  \r\nNotably, the veteran argues that he experiences intermittent \r\npain in his right ankle and that \"pain is a pathology \r\nalthough subjective.\"  However, pain alone, without a \r\ndiagnosed or underlying malady or condition, is not a \r\ndisability for which service connection may be granted. \r\n Sanchez-Benitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999), aff'd in \r\npart, vacated and remanded in part on other grounds, 259 F.3d \r\n1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  \r\nThe veteran's representative argues that the November 2007 VA \r\nexamination was incomplete because the examiner did not opine \r\nas to the severity of the veteran's right ankle disability or \r\nopine as to its etiology.  Inasmuch as a chronic right ankle \r\ndisability was not found on that examination, the argument is \r\nbaseless.\r\n\r\nAbsent competent evidence of a medical diagnosis of a current \r\nright ankle disability service connection for such disability \r\ncannot be granted.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 \r\n(1992).  Hence, the claim must be denied.  [The veteran is \r\nadvised that a future showing of chronic right ankle \r\ndisability could be a basis for reopening this claim.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a right ankle disability is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

Thomas Knope, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from January to March 1974.\r\n\r\nThis matter is on appeal from the Nashville, Tennessee, \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO)\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  In an unappealed rating decisions dated in October 1974, \r\nDecember 1982, and May 2004, the RO denied entitlement to \r\nservice connection for pes planus with tarsal arthritis.  \r\n\r\n2.  The May 2004 rating decision is the last final denial for \r\na foot disorder on any basis.\r\n\r\n3.  The evidence added to the record since May 2004 does not \r\nrelate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the \r\nclaim or raise the reasonable possibility of substantiating \r\nthe previously disallowed claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe evidence received since May 2004 is not new and material, \r\nand the requirements to reopen a claim of entitlement to \r\nservice connection for pes planus with tarsal arthritis have \r\nnot been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5108, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107(b), \r\n7105 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.156, 3.159 (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn order for evidence to be sufficient to reopen a previously \r\ndisallowed claim, it must be both new and material.  If the \r\nevidence is new, but not material, the inquiry ends and the \r\nclaim cannot be reopened.  See Smith v. West, 12 Vet. App. \r\n312, 314 (1999).  If it is determined that new and material \r\nevidence has been submitted, the claim must be reopened.  \r\nManio v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 140 (1991).\r\n\r\nUnder the relevant regulation, \"new\" evidence is defined as \r\nevidence not previously submitted to agency decision-makers.  \r\n\"Material\" evidence means existing evidence that, by itself \r\nor when considered with previous evidence of record, relates \r\nto an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  \r\n\r\nWhen determining whether the claim should be reopened, the \r\ncredibility of the newly submitted evidence is presumed.  \r\nJustus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510 (1992).  However, lay \r\nassertions of medical causation cannot serve as the predicate \r\nto reopen a claim under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5108.  See Moray v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 211, 214 (1993).  \r\n\r\nNew and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor \r\nredundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last \r\nprior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened, and \r\nmust raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the \r\nclaim.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a).  If it finds that the submitted \r\nevidence is new and material, VA may then proceed to evaluate \r\nthe merits of the claim on the basis of all evidence of \r\nrecord, but only after ensuring that the duty to assist the \r\nveteran in developing the facts necessary for the claim has \r\nbeen satisfied.  See Elkins v. West, 12 Vet. App. 209 (1999); \r\nbut see 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (eliminates the concept of a \r\nwell-grounded claim).\r\n\r\nBecause the Board has the jurisdictional responsibility to \r\nconsider whether it was proper to reopen the claim, \r\nregardless of the RO's determination on the question of \r\nreopening, the Board will determine whether new and material \r\nevidence has been received and, if so, consider entitlement \r\nto service connection on the merits.  Jackson v. Principi, \r\n265 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed Cir. 2001); Barnett v. Brown, 83 \r\nF.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \r\n\r\nThe veteran is claiming entitlement to service connection for \r\npes planus with tarsal arthritis.  The RO initially denied \r\nthis claim in October 1974 on the basis that the disorder was \r\nnoted prior to service, congenital in nature, and not \r\naggravated by active duty service.  He did not appeal the \r\nRO's decision and, in October 1975, the decision became \r\nfinal.  The evidence of record at the time of the October \r\n1974 decision included his service treatment records and \r\nstatements he made in association with his claim.  \r\n\r\nIn May 1982 and February 2004, the veteran filed claims to \r\nreopen.  In support, he submitted additional written \r\nstatements, but no clinical evidence.  In December 1982 and \r\nMay 2004 rating decisions, respectively, his application to \r\nreopen was denied on the basis that none of the evidence was \r\nnew and material.  The May 2004 rating decision is the last \r\ndenial for a foot disorder on any basis.\r\n \r\nThe veteran filed the current claim in March 2006.  In \r\nsupport, he submitted various outpatient treatment records, \r\nincluding those showing a diagnosis of \"bilateral foot pain \r\nwith arthritic changes,\" and \"chronic arthralgias.\"  \r\nHowever, none of the outpatient treatment records offer an \r\nopinion as to etiology.  As a result, this evidence, while \r\nnew, is not material to the claim.\r\n\r\nThe veteran has also submitted a statement from March 2007 \r\nand X-ray from May 2007 pertaining to a bunionectomy and \r\nmetatarsal osteotomy that he underwent in March 2007.  While \r\nthese records are probative of his current status of his foot \r\ndisorder, they do not address the cause.  Consequently, these \r\nrecords, while new, are not material.  \r\n\r\nNext, he submitted an undated statement (received in October \r\n2004) from a Resident Coordinator of an unknown facility.  \r\nThe Resident Coordinator asserted that a review of the claims \r\nfile would show that the veteran was inducted with foot \r\nproblems and that he should have insisted that \"we\" take \r\ncare of the problem.  He maintained that the veteran \r\ncontinued to have the same problems today and that VA should \r\nstop stalling and grant pension immediately.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the veteran offered testimony at a hearing before \r\nthe RO in March 2008.  There, he stated that he never had \r\nfoot trouble prior to his enlistment into the Army, and \r\nattributed his current foot disorder to active duty service.  \r\n\r\nNeither the Resident Coordinator's nor the veteran's \r\nstatements are sufficient to reopen the claim.  A lay person \r\nis not competent to offer an opinion that requires medical \r\nexpertise, and consequently the statements do not constitute \r\nnew and material evidence to reopen the claim.  Moray v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 211, 214 (1995) (holding that lay \r\nassertions of medical causation cannot serve as a predicate \r\nto reopen a previously denied claim).\r\n\r\nConsequently, in this case, the Board finds that none of the \r\ncurrent evidence submitted by the veteran since the final \r\nrating decision is new and material under 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.156(a).  Thus, the claim to reopen is denied.   \r\n\r\nFinally, as provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance \r\nAct of 2000 (VCAA), VA has a duty to notify and assist \r\nclaimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 \r\n& Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 (as \r\namended), 3.326(a) (2008).  \r\n\r\nProper notice from VA must inform the claimant of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence not of record (1) \r\nthat is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will \r\nseek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to \r\nprovide.  Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  \r\nThis notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable \r\ndecision on a claim by the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 \r\nF.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. \r\nApp. 112 (2004).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the notice requirements of the VCAA apply to all \r\nfive elements of a service-connection claim, including: (1) \r\nveteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a \r\nconnection between the veteran's service and the disability; \r\n(4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the \r\ndisability.  See Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006).  Further, this notice must include information \r\nthat a disability rating and an effective date for the award \r\nof benefits will be assigned if service connection is \r\nawarded.  Id. at 486.  \r\n\r\nVCAA notice errors are presumed prejudicial unless VA shows \r\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the \r\nadjudication.  To overcome the burden of prejudicial error, \r\nVA must show (1) that any defect was cured by actual \r\nknowledge on the part of the claimant; (2) that a reasonable \r\nperson could be expected to understand from the notice what \r\nwas needed; or, (3) that a benefit could not have been \r\nawarded as a matter of law.  See Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 \r\nF.3d 881 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nIn claims to reopen, VA must both notify a claimant of the \r\nevidence and information that is necessary to reopen the \r\nclaim and of the evidence and information that is necessary \r\nto establish entitlement to the underlying claim for the \r\nbenefit that is being sought.  Kent v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. \r\nApp. 1 (2006).\r\n\r\nTo satisfy this requirement, VA is required to look at the \r\nbases for the denial in the prior decision and to provide the \r\nclaimant with a notice letter that describes what evidence \r\nwould be necessary to substantiate those elements required to \r\nestablish service connection that were found insufficient in \r\nthe previous denial.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the notice letter provided to the veteran in \r\nMay 2006 included the criteria for reopening a previously \r\ndenied claim, the criteria for establishing service \r\nconnection, and information concerning why the claim was \r\npreviously denied.  Consequently, the Board finds that \r\nadequate notice has been provided, as he was informed about \r\nwhat evidence was necessary to substantiate the elements \r\nrequired to establish service connection that were found \r\ninsufficient in the previous denial.  \r\n\r\nNext, VA has a duty to assist the veteran in the development \r\nof the claim.  This duty includes assisting him in the \r\nprocurement of service medical records and pertinent \r\ntreatment records and providing an examination when \r\nnecessary.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the RO obtained the veteran's VA outpatient \r\ntreatment records, as well as his own private treatment \r\nrecords.  Further, he was provided an opportunity to set \r\nforth his contentions during a hearing with the RO.\r\n\r\nA specific VA medical examination is not needed to consider \r\nwhether the veteran has submitted new and material evidence \r\nbut, rather, the Board has reviewed all the evidence \r\nsubmitted to the claims file since the last final denial.  \r\nTherefore, a remand for a VA examination is not warranted.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4)(iii) (2008).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that all necessary development has been \r\naccomplished, and therefore appellate review may proceed \r\nwithout prejudice to the veteran.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 \r\nVet. App. 384 (1993).  Significantly, neither he, nor his \r\nrepresentative, has identified, and the record does not \r\notherwise indicate, any additional existing evidence that is \r\nnecessary for a fair adjudication of the claim that has not \r\nbeen obtained.  \r\n\r\nHence, no further notice or assistance to the veteran is \r\nrequired to fulfill VA's duty to assist in the development of \r\nthe claim.

Smith, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1942 to \r\nDecember 1945.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a March 2005 rating action of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida.  This case has been advanced on the \r\ndocket.\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  In a July 1948 decision, the RO in Brooklyn, New York \r\ndenied service connection for a skin condition, claimed as \r\njungle rot, cut finger.  Following receipt of notification of \r\nthat determination, the veteran did not initiate a timely \r\nappeal of the denial, and the decision became final.\r\n\r\n2.  The evidence received since the RO's July 1948 denial of \r\nservice connection for a skin condition does not raise a \r\nreasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The RO's July 1948 decision that denied service \r\nconnection for a skin condition is final.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7105 \r\n(West 2002) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.104, 20.200, 20.302, 20.1103 \r\n(2008).\r\n\r\n2.   The evidence received since the RO's July 1948 \r\ndetermination is not new and material, and the claim of \r\nservice connection for a skin condition is not reopened.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5108 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a) (2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nDuties To Notify And Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, \r\n3.326(a).  \r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his or her representative of any information, \r\nand any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(b).  Proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of any \r\ninformation and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary \r\nto substantiate the claim, (2) that VA will seek to provide, \r\nand (3) that the claimant is expected to provide; and (4) \r\nmust ask the claimant to provide any evidence in his \r\npossession that pertains to the claim, in accordance with 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1).  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans \r\nClaims (Court) has held that VCAA notice should be provided \r\nto a claimant before the initial RO decision on a claim.  \r\nPelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing notice requirements were satisfied by an \r\nOctober 2004 letter.  Importantly, that letter acknowledged \r\nthe prior denial of service connection, and notified the \r\nveteran that \"new and material\" evidence was necessary to \r\nreopen that issue.  The RO explained to the veteran that the \r\nnecessary evidence must demonstrate a currently-shown skin \r\ncondition, as such evidence was not present at the time of \r\nthe prior final decision.  See Kent v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. \r\nApp. 1 (2006).  The veteran was informed of the law and \r\nregulations governing the assignment of disability ratings \r\nand effective dates in a March 2006 letter.  See \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Thus, \r\nthe Board finds that VA's duty to notify has been met.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it appears that all evidence identified by the \r\nveteran relative to his claim has been obtained and \r\nassociated with the claims file.  In this regard, the Board \r\nnotes that the veteran has indicated pertinent private \r\ntreatment during the summer of 1948.  In June 2006, he \r\nprovided a release form which indicated the name of the \r\ntreating physician along with an incomplete address, noting \r\nthat the exact address and zip code was unknown.  He \r\nindicated that he had tried several sources, including the \r\ninternet, the Brooklyn AMA, and family members, in an effort \r\nto obtain further information regarding the physician.  The \r\nveteran is responsible for providing pertinent evidence in \r\nhis possession.  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 \r\n(1991) & Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 68 (1993) (in which \r\nthe Court held that VA's duty to assist is not a one-way \r\nstreet and that, if a veteran wishes help, he/she cannot \r\npassively wait for it in those circumstances where his/her \r\nown actions are essential in obtaining the putative \r\nevidence).  It is therefore the Board's conclusion that the \r\nveteran has been provided with every opportunity to submit \r\nevidence and argument in support of his claim, and to respond \r\nto VA notices.  A remand to accord the veteran another \r\nopportunity to provide the names, dates, and locations of \r\npost-service skin treatment is not necessary.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board acknowledges that the veteran has not \r\nbeen accorded a VA examination pertinent to his claim on \r\nappeal.  However, as will be discussed in the following \r\ndecision, service medical records are negative for complaints \r\nor findings of a skin condition, and available post-service \r\nmedical records do not reflect a current diagnosis of a skin \r\ncondition.  Thus, a remand to accord him an opportunity to \r\nundergo a VA examination that specifically addresses the \r\netiology of the claimed skin condition is not necessary.  \r\nVA's duty to assist is not invoked where \"no reasonable \r\npossibility exists that such assistance would aid in \r\nsubstantiating the claim.\"  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. \r\nApp. 370 (2002) & 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(a)(2).  See also & \r\nMcLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty \r\nto assist the veteran in apprising him as to the evidence \r\nneeded, and in obtaining evidence pertinent to his claim \r\nunder the VCAA.  Therefore, no useful purpose would be served \r\nin remanding this matter for yet more development.  Such a \r\nremand would result in unnecessarily imposing additional \r\nburdens on VA, with no additional benefit flowing to the \r\nappellant.  The Court has held that such remands are to be \r\navoided.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).\r\nStandard Of Review\r\n\r\nOnce the evidence has been assembled, it is the Board's \r\nresponsibility to evaluate the record.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance of evidence \r\nregarding the merits of an issue material to the \r\ndetermination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in \r\nresolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.  In Gilbert v. Derwinski, \r\n1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990), the Court stated that \"a veteran \r\nneed only demonstrate that there is an 'approximate balance \r\nof positive and negative evidence' in order to prevail.\"  To \r\ndeny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate \r\nagainst the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 \r\n(1996), citing Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nEvidence of record at the time of the July 1948 RO decision \r\nincludes a December 1945 separation examination report which \r\nindicates \"atabrine tint\" of the skin.  None of the \r\nevidence reflects complaints or findings of a skin disorder, \r\nhowever.  Based on this evidence, the RO denied service \r\nconnection for \"jungle rot, cut finger.\"  The veteran did \r\nnot appeal this decision to the Board.  Thus, the RO's \r\ndecision is final.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7105, C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.104, \r\n20.200, 20.302, 20.1103 (2008).  In September 2004, the \r\nveteran again submitted a claim of service connection for a \r\nskin condition.  \r\n\r\nA veteran may reopen a previously and finally denied claim by \r\nsubmitting new and material evidence.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a) \r\n(2008).  New evidence is defined as existing evidence not \r\npreviously submitted to agency decisionmakers.  Material \r\nevidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when \r\nconsidered with previous evidence of record, relates to an \r\nunestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  New \r\nand material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant \r\nof the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final \r\ndenial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a \r\nreasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a) (2007).  See also Hodge v. West, 155 \r\nF.3d 1356, 1359 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 1998).  In deciding the issue of whether newly \r\nreceived evidence is \"new and material,\" the credibility of \r\nthe evidence must be presumed.  \r\nJustus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 512, 513 (1992).\r\n\r\nAt the time of the July 1948 decision, the RO determined that \r\nthe evidence failed to show a skin disorder.  Since that \r\ntime, the veteran has reported pertinent treatment by a \r\nprivate physician; however, he has not provided any records \r\nof such treatment, and has stated that he is unable to \r\nprovide complete contact information for that physician which \r\nmight aid VA in obtaining such records.  In short, the \r\nveteran has not submitted any additional evidence which \r\nreflects treatment or findings of skin condition.  In this \r\nregard, the Board notes that the veteran is competent to give \r\nevidence about what he experienced; for example, he is \r\ncompetent to report that he experiences certain symptoms.  \r\nSee, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  He is \r\nnot, however, competent to diagnose any medical disorder or \r\nrender an opinion as to the cause or etiology of any current \r\ndisorder because he does not have the requisite medical \r\nknowledge or training.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 492 (1992).\r\n\r\nBecause the evidence received after the RO's 1948 decision \r\ndoes not demonstrate findings of a skin condition, such \r\nevidence does not raise a reasonable probability of \r\nsubstantiating the claim of service connection for this \r\ncondition.  This additional evidence is, therefore, not new \r\nand material, as contemplated by the pertinent law and \r\nregulations, and cannot serve as a basis to reopen the \r\nveteran's claim of service connection for a skin condition.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5108; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.156(a) (2008).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nNew and material evidence sufficient to reopen the previously \r\ndenied claim of service connection for a skin disorder has \r\nnot been received, the appeal is denied.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL E.

Casula, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from June 1970 to July 5, \r\n1972.  He then served with the Wyoming Air National Guard, \r\nand had a period of active duty for training (ADT) from April \r\n1, 1974 to April 19, 1974.  In May 1975, he was medically \r\ndisqualified from service with the Air National Guard.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) from a n July 2006 rating decision of the Fort \r\nHarrison, Montana, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA) which denied service connection for a \r\nsubarachnoid bleed.  In April 2007, the veteran testified at \r\na hearing at the RO before the undersigned Veterans Law \r\nJudge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the competent evidence is against \r\nfinding that there is a link between any residuals of a \r\nsubarachnoid bleed and any incident of the veteran's active \r\nmilitary service or ADT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResiduals of a subarachnoid bleed were not incurred in or \r\naggravated during active military service or ADT.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 101(24), 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.6, \r\n3.303 (2007).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) enhanced \r\nVA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a \r\nclaim for VA benefits, as codified in pertinent part at 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, \r\n3.159, 3.326(a).\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete \r\napplication for benefits, VA is required to notify the \r\nclaimant and his representative of any information, and any \r\nmedical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate \r\nthe claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b); \r\nQuartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper \r\nnotice from VA must inform the claimant of any information \r\nand evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and \r\n(3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159(b)(1), as amended, 73 Fed. Reg. 23,353 (April 30, \r\n2008).  This notice must be provided prior to an initial \r\ndecision on a claim by the RO.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 \r\nF.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. \r\nApp. 112 (2004). \r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice requirements apply to all five elements of a \r\nservice connection claim:  (1) veteran status; (2) existence \r\nof disability; (3) connection between service and the \r\ndisability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date \r\nof benefits where a claim is granted.  Dingess v. Nicholson, \r\n19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006).\r\n\r\nIf complete notice is not provided until after the initial \r\nadjudication, such a timing error can be cured by subsequent \r\nlegally adequate VCAA notice, followed by readjudication of \r\nthe claim, as in a Statement of the Case (SOC) or \r\nSupplemental SOC (SSOC).  Moreover, where there is an uncured \r\ntiming defect in the notice, subsequent action by the RO \r\nwhich provides the claimant a meaningful opportunity to \r\nparticipate in the processing of the claim can prevent any \r\nsuch defect from being prejudicial.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, \r\n499 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Prickett v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held \r\nthat, if a claimant can demonstrate error in VCAA notice, \r\nsuch error should be presumed to be prejudicial.  VA then \r\nbears the burden of rebutting the presumption, by showing \r\nthat the essential fairness of the adjudication has not been \r\naffected because, for example, actual knowledge by the \r\nclaimant cured the notice defect, a reasonable person would \r\nhave understood what was needed, or the benefits sought \r\ncannot be granted as a matter of law.  Sanders v. Nicholson, \r\n487 F.3d 861 (Fed. Cir. 2007); petition for cert. granted \r\n(U.S. June 16, 2008) (No. 07-1209).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the VCAA duty to notify was satisfied by way of \r\nletters sent to the veteran in January 2006 and March 2006 \r\nthat fully addressed the notice elements.  The January 2006 \r\nletter was sent prior to the initial RO decision in this \r\nmatter.  These letters informed the veteran of what evidence \r\nwas required to substantiate the claim and of his and VA's \r\nrespective duties for obtaining evidence.  Although no longer \r\nrequired, the veteran was also asked to submit evidence \r\nand/or information in his possession to the RO.  The March \r\n2006 letter informed him of how disability ratings and \r\neffective dates are assigned.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, \r\nsupra.  Further notice was sent to him in August 2006 \r\nalthough the predecisional letters were sufficient to comply \r\nwith the requirements of the VCAA.  Moreover, he has not \r\ndemonstrated any error in VCAA notice, and therefore the \r\npresumption of prejudicial error as to such notice does not \r\narise in this case.  See Sanders v. Nicholson, supra.  Thus, \r\nthe Board concludes that all required notice has been given \r\nto the veteran.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds VA has satisfied its duty to assist the \r\nveteran in the development of the claim.  The RO has obtained \r\nthe veteran's VA and private treatment records, and a VA \r\nexamination with opinion was conducted in February 2007.  It \r\nappears that all obtainable evidence identified by the \r\nveteran relative to his claim has been obtained and \r\nassociated with the claims file, and that neither he nor his \r\nrepresentative has identified any other pertinent evidence, \r\nnot already of record, which would need to be obtained for a \r\nfair disposition of this appeal.  It is, therefore, the \r\nBoard's conclusion that no further notice or assistance to \r\nthe veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist him in \r\nthe development of the claim.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. \r\n227 (2000), aff'd 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Dela Cruz \r\nv. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); see also Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, supra.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty \r\nto assist the veteran in apprising him as to the evidence \r\nneeded, and in obtaining evidence pertinent to his claim \r\nunder the VCAA.  Therefore, no useful purpose would be served \r\nin remanding this matter for yet more development.  Such a \r\nremand would result in unnecessarily imposing additional \r\nburdens on VA, with no additional benefit flowing to the \r\nveteran.  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held \r\nthat such remands are to be avoided.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 \r\nVet. App. 426, 430 (1994).\r\n\r\nII. Factual Background\r\n\r\nPrivate treatment records from Memorial Hospital show that in \r\nJune 1974, the veteran was brought to the emergency room \r\nafter his employer, J.H., found him unconscious and lying on \r\nthe ground.  The veteran was working as a farm hand at the \r\ntime, and had been left at night to operate a press, and was \r\nfound the next morning on the floor by the machinery, \r\nunconscious, and with blood in his mouth.  A subarachnoid \r\nhemorrhage was suspected, and the cause was to be determined.  \r\n\r\nVA treatment records show that the veteran was transferred to \r\nthe Cheyenne VA Medical Center (VAMC), and then to the Denver \r\nVA Hospital in July 1974, for treatment for a subarachnoid \r\nhemorrhage.  In the Denver VA Hospital summary it was noted \r\nthat prior to the June 1974 accident, the veteran was \r\n\"entirely well excerpt, perhaps, for mild recent headaches \r\nin retrospect\".  He underwent a craniotomy and biopsies of \r\nmultiple areas.  He made a gradual recovery from the bleed, \r\nand at the time of discharge he had moderate left hemiparesis \r\nof the leg and the arm.  The discharge diagnoses included \r\npossible brain tumor, possible inflammatory disease of \r\nunknown etiology, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.  He was to \r\ntransfer to another VA Hospital to undergo aggressive \r\nphysical therapy, however, after two days at that facility, \r\nhis wound was found to be draining.\r\n\r\nAn August 1974 VA treatment record shows that the veteran was \r\ntransferred again to the Denver VA Hospital with an infected \r\nsurgical wound.  He was treated for an infection, and \r\nreleased in September 1974.\r\n\r\nIn October 1974 the veteran was re-admitted to the Denver VA \r\nHospital after his wound continued to drain, and it was felt \r\nhe had bone flap osteomyelitis.  He underwent debridement of \r\nthe bone flap with removal of the infected bone.  In his \r\nmedical history, it was noted that multiple biopsies of his \r\nbrain had revealed only inflammatory cells with no evidence \r\nof tumor.  \r\n\r\nService treatment records (STRs), from the veteran's service \r\nas a Reserve in the Air National Guard, show that in April \r\n1975 he underwent a discharge examination.  He was found to \r\nbe medically disqualified from service with the National \r\nGuard due to his history of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nIn a December 1975 report, prepared for the Social Security \r\nAdministration, a private physician examined the veteran and \r\nfound that the major disability at the time was that his \r\nmemory was still defective.  He also reported some fatigue, \r\nwhich had been gradually improving, and some slight \r\nunsteadiness of gait.\r\n\r\nA February 1976 VA hospital summary showed that the veteran \r\nwas hospitalized and underwent a cranioplasty for a skull \r\ndefect.  \r\n\r\nIn a September 1977 letter, a VA physician wrote a letter for \r\nthe veteran, noting that in June 1974 he suffered a \r\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage, and at the time he was cutting hay.  \r\nThe VA physician indicated that while it was not possible to \r\nprove that the veteran's subarachnoid hemorrhage was job-\r\nrelated, it was \"true that exertion can bring on an episode \r\nof subarachnoid hemorrhage in a patient with an aneurysm or \r\nother predisposition to the problem.\"  The VA physician \r\nfurther opined that it was entirely possible that the \r\nveteran's job contributed to the problem.\r\n\r\nIn a September 1977 letter, another VA physician wrote a \r\nletter to \"verify certain unique features of [the veteran's] \r\nmedical history,\" noting that the veteran had partially \r\nrecovered from the effects of the subarachnoid hemorrhage in \r\n1974.\r\n\r\nIn an August 1981 private neurological consultation, Dr. S. \r\nopined that the site of the veteran's right parieto-occiptial \r\ncraniotomy in June 1974 would suggest that the probable cause \r\nwas a small angioma with intra- and subarachnoid hemorrhage.  \r\nDr. S. did not think it was an aneurysm.  Dr. S. also noted \r\nthat the sequelae to the subarachnoid hemorrhage included \r\nleft homonymous hemianopsia.  Dr. S. believed the veteran's \r\nleft-side cerebellar signs, however, stemmed from brain stem \r\ncompression at a time before the craniotomy.  Dr. S. referred \r\nthe veteran for further evaluations of his mental functions.  \r\n\r\nA VA general medical examination in April 1999 showed that \r\nveteran reported that after his subarachnoid hemorrhage in \r\n1974 he had temporary paralysis of his left side, but \r\nreported that currently, on a day to day basis, he did not \r\nhave any dramatic, noticeable differences between his left \r\nupper or lower extremities.  The impressions included history \r\nof subarachnoid hemorrhage with minor balance difficulties \r\nnoted on examination, and an otherwise normal complete \r\nhistory, physical, and neurological examination.  \r\n\r\nIn an April 1999 report by a private ophthalmologist, Dr. B., \r\nit was noted that the veteran underwent a craniotomy in 1974 \r\nto evacuate a subarachnoid bleed, and was left with a dense \r\nleft field defect.  The impressions were left dense \r\nhomonymous hemianopia secondary to a subarachnoid bleed in \r\n1974; peripapillary chorodial nevus, O.D.; and mild optic \r\natrophy, O.S., probably related to increased intracranial \r\npressure with a subarachnoid bleed. \r\n\r\nReceived from the veteran in January 2006 was his claim for \r\nservice connection for residuals of subarachnoid bleed.  He \r\nclaimed that in June of 1974 he had a \"blood vessel rupture \r\nin the back of [his] brain\" and believed this \"could have \r\nbeen caused by [his] time as a crew member on C130's in the \r\nAir Force.\"  Along with his claim, the veteran submitted \r\nmultiple internet excerpts pertaining to stroke and to \r\npulmonary embolisms and deep venous thrombosis being related \r\nto air travel.  \r\n\r\nVA and private treatment records (from St. James Hospital) \r\nshowed that the veteran had a seizure in March 2006, and was \r\nnoted to have a new onset of seizure disorder.  A March 2006 \r\nVA treatment record showed that the veteran underwent an EEG \r\nand the impression was an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG with \r\nevidence of a mild to moderate degree of generalized slowing \r\nin the right parieto-occipital region, consistent with the \r\nveteran's past history of brain injury.  \r\n\r\nIn support of his claim, the veteran has submitted numerous \r\nexcerpts from the internet, which primarily pertain to the \r\nrelationship between developing deep vein thrombosis due to \r\nlong air flights.  \r\n\r\nOn VA examination in February 2007, the examiner noted that \r\nthe veteran claimed that while on guard duty he flew to and \r\nfrom Hawaii on a C-130, and felt that the long flight was the \r\netiology of his subarachnoid hemorrhage two months later.  He \r\ndenied a history of head injury.  He reported he was placed \r\non Dilantin in 1974 for four to five years, after he was \r\ndiagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage, following a seizure \r\nor syncopal episode in June 1974.  He claimed he discontinued \r\nthe Dilantin, and was fine, until March 2006, when he \r\nexperienced his second seizure and was put back on Dilantin.  \r\nHe claimed residual left-sided weakness and peripheral visual \r\nloss, left greater than on the right.  The examiner conducted \r\na \"literature review,\" and was unable to locate any \r\nliterature that would support the claim that a subarachnoid \r\nhemorrhage was secondary to a long flight.  The examiner \r\nopined that the veteran's subarachnoid hemorrhage was \r\n\"neither due to or caused by an air flight to Hawaii or any \r\nother air transport that [the veteran] may have \r\nexperienced.\"  The VA examiner also opined that it was \r\n\"less likely as not\" that the subarachnoid hemorrhage was \r\ndue to or caused by \"any event associated with the National \r\nGuard 33 years ago.\"\r\n\r\nIn April 2007, the veteran and his wife testified at a \r\nhearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  He \r\ntestified that during his period of ADT in April 1974 he flew \r\ncargo, in a C-130, from Cheyenne, Wyoming to Hawaii for \r\ntraining, and then flew back after three days.  He testified \r\nthat he had severe headaches, but he could not remember if it \r\nwas before or after the flight.  He claimed that during that \r\nperiod of ADT he developed a deep vein thrombosis due to the \r\nextended flight time, and that this caused the hemorrhage.  \r\nHe testified that the insurance company for his employer at \r\nthe time of the subarachnoid hemorrhage would not cover his \r\naccident, finding it to be a pre-existing condition.  He had \r\nworked for that employer for only four to six weeks before \r\nthe accident.  He testified that none of his doctors have \r\nindicated the possibility of a deep vein thrombosis causing \r\nhis hemorrhage, and that his doctors have said what could not \r\nhave happened, including not a stroke or a heart attack, but \r\nthat the doctors never told him what actually did happen.  \r\n\r\nIn a May 2007 statement, the veteran's former employer, J.H., \r\nreported that the veteran worked for him during the summer in \r\nthe early 1970s and experienced a brain hemorrhage while \r\nworking in the field.  J.H. reported that the veteran had \r\npreviously experienced severe headaches while on a flight to \r\nHawaii as a member of the Air National Guard, and because of \r\nthat, the veteran reportedly had to stop work and lie in the \r\nshade.  J.H. reported that because of the headaches the \r\nveteran had experienced earlier, the insurance company \r\nrefused the claim for the veteran's medical expenses, stating \r\nit was a previously existing condition.\r\n\r\nIII. Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nservice.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  \r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed \r\nafter discharge, when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disability was \r\nincurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nActive military, naval or air service includes any period of \r\nactive duty for training (ADT) during which the individual \r\nconcerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury \r\nincurred in the line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 101(24); 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.6(c)(1).\r\n\r\nIn order to prevail on the issue of service connection, there \r\nmust be medical evidence of a current disability; medical or, \r\nin certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service \r\nincurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and medical \r\nevidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or \r\ninjury and the present disease or injury.  See Hickson v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999).\r\n\r\nThe threshold requirement for service connection is competent \r\nevidence of the current existence of the claimed disorder.  \r\nDegmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).  In that regard, \r\nthe Board recognizes that the Court has held that the \r\npresence of a chronic disability at any time during the claim \r\nprocess can justify a grant of service connection, even where \r\nthe most recent diagnosis is negative.  McClain v. Nicholson, \r\n21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  However, where the evidence fails \r\nto show chronicity of the claimed disorder at any time or \r\nwhere the evidence fails to show a nexus between the claimed \r\ndisability and service many years before (as in this case), \r\nthat holding would not be applicable.\r\n\r\nMedical evidence is generally required to establish a medical \r\ndiagnosis or to address questions of medical causation; lay \r\nassertions of medical status do not constitute competent \r\nmedical evidence for these purposes.  Espiritu v. Derwinski, \r\n2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  However, lay statements may \r\nserve to support a claim for service connection by supporting \r\nthe occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of \r\ndisability or symptoms of disability subject to lay \r\nobservation.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a); \r\nJandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed Cir. 2007); \r\nBuchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) \r\n(addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support \r\npresence of disability even where not corroborated by \r\ncontemporaneous medical evidence).\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends he suffered a subarachnoid bleed in June \r\n1974, two months after a period of ADT in April 1974.  He \r\nclaims he had to take two long flights (from Wyoming to \r\nHawaii and then back) during that period of ADT, which caused \r\na deep vein thrombosis to occur, which eventually led to his \r\nsubarachnoid bleed.  \r\n\r\nPrivate and VA treatment records show that the veteran \r\nsuffered a subarachnoid bleed in June 1974.  The primary \r\nresiduals of the cranial bleed were moderate left hemiparesis \r\nof the leg and the arm and vision loss.  In April 1999 he was \r\nnoted to have minor balance difficulties and vision \r\nimpairment, due to the subarachnoid bleed.  An EEG in March \r\n2006 showed a mild to moderate degree of generalized slowing \r\nin the right parieto-occipital region, consistent with the \r\nveteran's past history of brain injury.  In April 2007, he \r\nclaimed residual left-sided weakness and peripheral visual \r\nloss, left greater than on the right.  Thus, the record \r\nreflects that the veteran does indeed have current residual \r\ndisability, resulting from his subarachnoid bleed of many \r\nyears ago.  Degmetich, supra; McClain, supra.  \r\n\r\nWhat is missing from the record, however, is competent \r\nevidence showing that the veteran has a current \r\ndisability/residual of the subarachnoid bleed which may be \r\nrelated to active military service, specifically to his \r\nperiod of ADT in April 1974.  A review of the record shows no \r\nsuch competent evidence.  While there is evidence reflecting \r\nthat the veteran had a period of ADT in early April 1974 and \r\nsuffered a subarachnoid bleed two months after, there is no \r\ncompetent evidence of record linking the two.  In February \r\n2007, the VA examiner opined that the veteran's subarachnoid \r\nhemorrhage was \"neither due to or caused by\" a flight to \r\nHawaii or any other air transport he may have experienced, \r\nwas \"less likely as not\" due to or caused by any event \r\nassociated with the veteran's National Guard service.  While \r\nthe 2007 VA examiner's opinion may not be worded as \r\narticulately as might be preferred, the gist of the opinion \r\nis clear.  Moreover, the veteran has submitted no competent \r\nevidence to the contrary.  \r\n\r\nWhile the veteran has submitted numerous internet excerpts in \r\nsupport of his claim, a review of these excerpts show that \r\nthey primarily discuss the relationship between developing a \r\npulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to a long \r\nairplane flight.  The problem here is that these internet \r\narticles constitute general information, which is devoid of \r\nany medical evidence or opinion specific to the veteran's own \r\nmedical situation, and are of minimal probative value.  \r\nAlthough it is true that \"[a] veteran with a competent \r\nmedical diagnosis of a current disorder may invoke an \r\naccepted medical treatise in order to establish the required \r\nnexus [to show service connection]\", Hensley v. West, 212 \r\nF.3d 1255, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2000), the general rule is that \r\n\"an attempt to establish a medical nexus to a disease or \r\ninjury solely by generic information in a medical journal or \r\ntreatise 'is too general and inconclusive' . . . .\"  Mattern \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 222, 229 (1999) (citing cases).\r\n\r\nIt is true that the veteran's lay statements may be competent \r\nto support a claim for service connection by supporting the \r\noccurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of \r\ndisability or symptoms of disability subject to lay \r\nobservation.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303(a), \r\n3.159(a); Jandreau, supra; Buchanan, supra.  Along those \r\nlines, the veteran is certainly competent to report that he \r\nhad a flight from Wyoming to Hawaii and then back during his \r\nperiod of ADT in April 1974.  He is also competent to report \r\nhe had headaches at that time.  To that end, the Board notes \r\nthat in July 1974 he reported having mild headaches prior to \r\nthe bleed, but in April 2007 he testified he had severe \r\nheadaches at that time, but could not remember if it was \r\nbefore or after the flight to Hawaii.  As a layperson, \r\nhowever, the veteran is not competent to provide a medical \r\ndiagnosis or to establish a medical link between an in-\r\nservice flight and a post-service subarachnoid bleed.  \r\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  Relating a \r\nsubarachnoid bleed, which from the medical evidence of record \r\nclearly had an onset in June 1974, to a reported in-service \r\nflight in April 1974, especially with gaps in the medical \r\nrecord (i.e., the two month period of time in between, and \r\nthat the veteran was never diagnosed with having a pulmonary \r\nembolism or a deep vein thrombosis), requires opinion \r\nevidence from experts with medical training, and is not \r\nsubject to lay diagnosis.  See Jandreau, supra.\r\n\r\nWith consideration of the evidence of record and the absence \r\nof any medical opinion suggesting a causal link between the \r\nveteran's period of ADT in April 1974 and his subsequent \r\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and resulting disability, the Board \r\nfinds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nveteran's claim of service connection for residuals of a \r\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage.  Consequently, the benefit-of-the-\r\ndoubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 49, 55 \r\n(1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for residuals of a subarachnoid bleed is \r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nHOLLY E.

Berry, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nJ. B. Freeman, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant served on active duty from September 1968 to \r\nFebruary 1970.  \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non remand from the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court).  In an August 2009 Order, the Court \r\nendorsed a July 2009 joint motion for remand, vacated the \r\nportion of the March 2008 Board decision that, in pertinent \r\npart, reopened and denied the PTSD claim, and remanded the \r\nmatter for compliance with the instructions in the joint \r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, the matter of the claim for service connection \r\nfor PTSD came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a February 2000 rating decision of the RO in \r\nChicago, Illinois, which declined reopening of the claim.  \r\n\r\nThe March 2008 Board decision also denied a claim for \r\ncompensation under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1151 for hypokalemia as a \r\nresult of treatment at a VA medical facility.  The July 2009 \r\nJoint Motion for Remand indicates that the issue was \r\nabandoned before the Court.  The Board need not address it \r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that \r\nthe appellant's alleged inservice stressor actually occurred, \r\nand against a finding that any depression or anxiety is \r\nrelated to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe appellant's PTSD with depression and anxiety was not \r\nincurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n1101, 1110, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304 \r\n(2009).\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the \r\nappellant's claims folders.  Although the Board has an \r\nobligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this \r\ndecision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the \r\nevidence submitted by the appellant or on his behalf.  See \r\nGonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) \r\n(the Board must review the entire record, but does not have \r\nto discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below \r\nfocuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what \r\nthis evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims.  The \r\nappellant must not assume that the Board has overlooked \r\npieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.  \r\nSee Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law \r\nrequires only that the Board address its reasons for \r\nrejecting evidence favorable to the veteran).  \r\n\r\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of all \r\nevidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its \r\nprobative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be \r\npersuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for \r\nrejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  Equal \r\nweight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in \r\nthe record; every item of evidence does not have the same \r\nprobative value.  When all the evidence is assembled, VA is \r\nresponsible for determining whether the evidence supports the \r\nclaim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant \r\nprevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is \r\ndenied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nI. Veterans Claims Assistance Act\r\n\r\nWith respect to the appellant's claim, VA has met all \r\nstatutory and regulatory notice and duty to assist \r\nprovisions.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, \r\n5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326.\r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, when VA receives a complete or substantially \r\ncomplete application for benefits, it is required to notify \r\nthe claimant and his representative, if any, of any \r\ninformation and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) (2009).  The United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA must inform \r\nthe claimant of any information and evidence not of record \r\n(1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA \r\nwill seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected \r\nto provide.  Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).\r\n\r\nThe Court observed that a claim of entitlement to service \r\nconnection consists of five elements, of which notice must be \r\nprovided prior to the initial adjudication: (1) veteran \r\nstatus; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection \r\nbetween the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree \r\nof disability; and (5) effective date.  See Dingess v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 490 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. \ufffd \r\n5103(a).  Compliance with the first Quartuccio element \r\nrequires notice of these five elements.  See id.\r\n\r\nA letter dated in April 2003 fully satisfied the duty to \r\nnotify provisions for the first three elements.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1); Quartuccio, at 187.  The \r\nApril 2003 letter, however, misidentified the type of PTSD \r\nclaim for which the appellant had filed.  The appellant was \r\nsent a correct notice letter in August 2006, which also \r\nsatisfied all of the notice requirements.  The appellant \r\nresponded in September 2006 by sending in authorized release \r\nforms which were signed, but identified no treatment \r\nprovider.  The RO subsequently notified the appellant of a \r\nfinding of unavailability regarding treatment records from \r\nthe Cincinnati VA Medical Center in April 2007.  In August \r\n2007, the appellant submitted a statement that he had no \r\nfurther evidence to submit.  Although the August 2006 letter \r\nwas not sent prior to initial adjudication of the appellant's \r\nclaim, this was not prejudicial to him, since the RO provided \r\ncontent-compliant statutory notice in August 2006, albeit in \r\nan untimely manner, and appellant, who was represented by an \r\nattorney, subsequently informed the VA that there was no \r\nfurther evidence to submit, failure of regional office (RO) \r\nto conduct a subsequent readjudication to cure the untimely \r\nnotice was not prejudicial error because the result of such a \r\nreadjudication would have been the same as the previous \r\nadjudication.  See Medrano v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 165 \r\n(2007).  \r\n\r\nThe Board also concludes VA's duty to assist has been \r\nsatisfied.  The appellant's Social Security Administration \r\nrecords have been associated with the file.  The appellant's \r\nservice medical records and VA medical records are in the \r\nfile.  The appellant claims to have had treatment at the \r\nCincinnati VA Medical Center just after his separation from \r\nservice.  The RO requested the appellant's Cincinnati VAMC \r\nrecords, but searches regarding treatment from separation in \r\n1970 found no additional records.  The RO made a finding of \r\nunavailability of records and notified the appellant in April \r\n2007.  The appellant also claimed to have additional \r\ntreatment from the VAMC in Madison, Wisconsin sometime after \r\nhis separation from service.  The RO obtained records from \r\nthe Madison VAMC, with the earliest dating from 1996.  The RO \r\nmade several searches and eventually made a finding of \r\nunavailability, of which the appellant was notified in \r\nOctober 2007.  The Board finds that a remand for further \r\nsearches would be fruitless.  Private medical records \r\nidentified by the appellant have been obtained, to the extent \r\npossible.  The Board notes that the appellant submitted an \r\nauthorized consent form in September 2006 following the \r\nAugust 2006 VCAA notice letter he received.  The appellant \r\nsigned the form without specifying a source from which \r\nrecords could be requested.  An August 2007 statement from \r\nthe appellant indicated that he had no further records to \r\nsubmit.  The appellant has at no time referenced outstanding \r\nrecords that he wanted VA to obtain or that he felt were \r\nrelevant to the claims.\r\n\r\nThe duty to assist also includes providing a medical \r\nexamination or obtaining a medical opinion when such is \r\nnecessary to make a decision on the claim, as defined by law.  \r\nThe case of McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), \r\nheld that an examination is required when (1) there is \r\nevidence of a current disability, (2) evidence establishing \r\nan \"in-service event, injury or disease,\" or a disease \r\nmanifested in accordance with presumptive service connection \r\nregulations occurred which would support incurrence or \r\naggravation, (3) an indication that the current disability \r\nmay be related to the in-service event, and (4) insufficient \r\nevidence to decide the case.\r\n\r\nThe Board concludes an examination is not needed in the PTSD, \r\ndepression and anxiety claim because the Board finds that \r\nthere is no credible evidence that the appellant suffered the \r\nalleged inservice assault he contends is the source of his \r\ndisability.  There is no reasonable possibility that a \r\nmedical opinion would aid in substantiating the appellant's \r\nclaim since it could not provide evidence of a past event.  \r\nAdditionally, specific psychiatric evaluations during service \r\ndid not identify a depressive or anxiety disorder.  Such a \r\ndisorder has not been present continuously since service.  \r\nThe Board finds that the appellant's statements regarding \r\ninservice events are not credible, as discussed below.  To \r\nthe extent that there are medical records indicating a \r\npsychiatric disorder since service, these rely on the \r\nappellant's statements.  Because the Board finds the \r\nappellant's reported history incredible, the factual \r\npredicate of these records is removed, rendering them \r\ninadequate for ratings purposes.  See Nieves- Rodriguez v. \r\nPeake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  There being no competent or \r\ncredible evidence in favor of a finding that the appellant \r\nhas a psychiatric disability related to service, remand for \r\nan examination and opinion is not warranted.  See McLendon, \r\nsupra.  \r\n\r\nAs there is no indication that any failure on the part of VA \r\nto provide additional notice or assistance reasonably affects \r\nthe outcome of this case, the Board finds that any such \r\nfailure is harmless.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d \r\n1298 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\r\n\r\nII. Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110.  For the showing of \r\nchronic disease in service there is required a combination of \r\nmanifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and \r\nsufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  If chronicity in service is not \r\nestablished, a showing of continuity of symptoms after \r\ndischarge is required to support the claim.  Id.  Service \r\nconnection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all of the evidence establishes that the \r\ndisease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn order to establish service connection for the claimed \r\ndisorder, there must be (1) competent and credible evidence \r\nof a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain \r\ncircumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or \r\naggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) competent and \r\ncredible evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service \r\ndisease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); see also Jandreau v. \r\nNicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. \r\nNicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The determination \r\nas to whether these requirements are met is based on an \r\nanalysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of \r\nits credibility and probative value.  See Baldwin v. West, 13 \r\nVet. App. 1, 8 (1999).  Service connection for PTSD requires \r\nmedical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the condition, \r\ncredible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service \r\nstressor actually occurred, and a link, established by \r\nmedical evidence, between the current symptomatology and the \r\nclaimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) (2009).\r\n\r\nThe appellant's claim stems from alleged inservice sexual \r\nassault he suffered during a personal assault, by three white \r\nservice members while in the Army.  The VA examiner in 2005 \r\nconfirmed the impressions on the record that diagnosed PTSD \r\nunder the current diagnostic criteria.  The VA examiner and \r\nhis attending therapists have also stated the appellant \r\nsuffered from PTSD as a result of his assault.  The Board's \r\ninquiry is confined to whether the evidence provides credible \r\nsupport to the appellant's claimed PTSD stressors, and \r\nwhether any depression and anxiety is attributable to \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nWhere the claimed stressor is not related to combat, a \r\nveteran's lay testimony alone will not be enough to establish \r\nthe occurrence of the alleged stressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, \r\n9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. \r\n163, 166 (1996).  In such cases, the record must contain \r\nservice records or other corroborative evidence which \r\nsubstantiates or verifies the veteran's testimony or \r\nstatements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  See \r\nWest (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki \r\nv. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).  Moreover, a medical \r\nopinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the \r\noccurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  See Cohen v. \r\nBrown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1997).\r\n\r\nIn Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 278 (1999), the U.S. \r\nCourt of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) pointed out that \r\nthere are special evidentiary procedures for PTSD claims \r\nbased on personal assault contained in VA ADJUDICATION MANUAL \r\nM21-1, Part III, para. 5.14c (February 20, 1996), and former \r\nM21-1, Part III, para. 7.46(c)(2) (October 11, 1995).  In \r\npersonal assault cases, more particularized requirements are \r\nestablished regarding the development of \"alternative \r\nsources\" of information as service records \"may be devoid \r\nof evidence because many victims of personal assault, \r\nespecially sexual assault and domestic violence, do not file \r\nofficial reports either with military or civilian \r\nauthorities.\"  VA ADJUDICATION PROCEDURAL MANUAL M21-1, Part \r\nIII, para. 5.14c(5).\r\n\r\nIn relevant part, the current 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) states as \r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(3) If a post-traumatic stress disorder claim is based \r\non in-service personal assault, evidence from sources \r\nother than the appellant's service records may \r\ncorroborate the appellant's account of the stressor \r\nincident.  Examples of such evidence include, but are \r\nnot limited to: records from law enforcement \r\nauthorities, rape crisis centers, mental health \r\ncounseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy \r\ntests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and \r\nstatements from family members, roommates, fellow \r\nservice members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior \r\nchanges following the claimed assault is one type of \r\nrelevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  \r\nExamples of behavior changes that may constitute \r\ncredible evidence of the stressor include, but are not \r\nlimited to: a request for a transfer to another military \r\nduty assignment; deterioration in work performance; \r\nsubstance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, \r\nor anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained \r\neconomic or social behavior changes.  VA will not deny a \r\npost-traumatic stress disorder claim that is based on \r\nin- service personal assault without first advising the \r\nclaimant that evidence from sources other than the \r\nappellant's service records or evidence of behavior \r\nchanges may constitute credible supporting evidence of \r\nthe stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to \r\nfurnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential \r\nsources of such evidence.  VA may submit any evidence \r\nthat it receives to an appropriate medical or mental \r\nhealth professional for an opinion as to whether it \r\nindicates that a personal assault occurred.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of record that the appellant suffered an assault \r\nduring service is comprised of his own statements and the \r\nstatement sent by his ex-wife.  \r\n\r\nIn a March 1995 statement in association with his original \r\nclaim, the appellant stated that the assault happened as he \r\nwas returning to base from drinking with friends.  He alleges \r\nthat he was beaten and raped and \"left for dead.\"  He \r\nindicates that he was so distraught that he returned to \r\nbarracks and attempted suicide.  A friend found him and he \r\nwas taken to the hospital.  He indicates that a psychiatrist \r\nsaw him, but did nothing thereafter.  A July 1995 follow up \r\nstatement indicates that the alleged assault and suicide \r\nattempt happened in the same night.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant's ex-wife submitted a December 2004 statement \r\nin which she described the appellant's behavior since his \r\nseparation from service.  She also states that she had \r\nvisited him in the hospital at Fort Polk during his service \r\nand that he was covered in bruises at that time.  She also \r\nindicates that he told her about the alleged assault.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant's service medical records record that the \r\nappellant attempted suicide at 1400 hours on January 7, 1969, \r\nat Fort Polk.  He overdosed on thirty to forty Anacin pills \r\nand was taken to the hospital.  The records include a \r\npsychiatric evaluation.  The report indicates that the \r\nappellant stated he was depressed due to numerous family \r\nproblems.  The psychiatrist diagnosed him with a chronic, \r\nmoderate passive aggressive reaction.  \r\n\r\nAn investigation was conducted on the incident.  The February \r\n1969 report indicates that the appellant, his cadre and \r\nfellow trainees who were in contact with the appellant at the \r\ntime of the overdose were interviewed.  A \"not in the line \r\nof duty\" determination was reached.  There is no indication \r\nthat the appellant was assaulted.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that there is no hint of an assault in the \r\nappellant's service medical records.  Instead, they point to \r\nfamily problems as leading to a suicide attempt.  The \r\noverdose occurred in the early afternoon.  Despite physical \r\nevaluation, there is no sign that the appellant had been \r\nbeaten.  Review of the complete file shows that the appellant \r\nwas never treated for injuries that are consistent with an \r\nassault.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant's service personnel records also show that the \r\nappellant had been having significant problems prior to \r\nJanuary 1969 overdose, which continued unabated after the \r\noverdose.  The appellant had a summary court martial for \r\nbeing absent without leave (AWOL) from December 9 to December \r\n16, 1968.  The appellant was confined between December 16 and \r\nDecember 23.  The appellant was also caught stealing several \r\nsmall items from other solders on January 3, 1969.  The \r\nappellant went AWOL on January 12 and 13.  The appellant \r\nspent the better part of the next nine months imprisoned.  He \r\nwas confined from January 18 through March 16, excepting \r\nFebruary 4, when he escaped.  The appellant was AWOL again on \r\nMarch 31.  From April 1 to April 6, the appellant was \r\nconfined by civilian authorities in Rockford, Illinois, a \r\nconsiderable distance from his duty station at Fort Polk, \r\nLouisiana.  The appellant was returned to the Army on April \r\n7, confined immediately and transferred to Fort Leavenworth, \r\nKansas.  The appellant was released from confinement on \r\nOctober 1, 1969, and spent the next five days AWOL.  The \r\nappellant's DD 214 also shows excess leave from October 25 to \r\nOctober 31, December 20 to December 30 and from January 16, \r\n1970 to January 27, 1970.  The appellant was provided with \r\nhis separation from service physical examination in November \r\n1969, which indicates that the appellant's superiors had \r\nbegun the process of separation shortly after the appellant's \r\nreturn from Fort Leavenworth.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant's performance evaluations are also of record.  \r\nThe appellant's initial performance ratings in October 1968 \r\nwere excellent.  The appellant began receiving unsatisfactory \r\nratings in December 1968, before the date of the alleged \r\nassault.  \r\n\r\nIn light of the extraordinary amount of time AWOL, confined \r\nand on excess leave, the Board finds that there was little \r\nleeway in the appellant's service for the purported assault \r\nto have occurred at another time.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the appellant's ex-wife claimed \r\nthat she was the reason that the appellant was sent to Fort \r\nLeavenworth.  Review of the appellant's record shows that he \r\nreceived a sentence of four month confinement following his \r\nconviction for escape from lawful confinement.  The Board is \r\nnot sure what the appellant's ex-wife meant by her statement.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant also claims that he was sent to prison in 1979 \r\nafter he found and shot one of the men who supposedly \r\nassaulted him during service.  To support this contention, \r\nthe appellant has submitted a partial transcript and an \r\nexhibit from his trial.  These documents, however, do not \r\nsupport his claims; rather, they contradict the appellant's \r\nstatements directly.\r\n\r\nIn November 1979, the appellant was arrested for shooting a \r\nman in a bar.  The police report from the shooting indicates \r\nthat the appellant shot a man over a dispute arising from a \r\npool game.  The victim began the altercation by shoving the \r\nappellant against a foosball table, whereupon the appellant \r\nproduced a gun and shot the victim multiple times.  There is \r\nno indication that the victim was one of those who supposedly \r\nassaulted the appellant during service.\r\n\r\nThe partial transcript from his trial contains a portion of \r\nthe testimony by a defense witness, a psychiatrist who \r\nevaluated the appellant in April 1980.  The partial \r\ntranscript does not contain the psychiatrist's diagnosis or \r\nthe relevant factors leading to that diagnosis.  Instead, the \r\ntranscript is focused on the question of whether the \r\nappellant was capable of forming culpable intent at the time \r\nof the shooting.  The psychiatrist had apparently discussed \r\nprevious violent behavior with the appellant.  The appellant \r\nrelated a story about a fight he had during service with his \r\ncommanding officer.  The appellant had requested additional \r\nleave to care for his family and been refused.  The appellant \r\nbecame angry with his commanding officer and attacked him.  \r\nWhile the appellant's personnel records do not record this \r\nincident, not all of his periods of confinement are explained \r\nand the story is consistent with the January 1969 psychiatric \r\nreport of extreme behavior and family problems.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence weighs against this claim.  \r\nThe appellant's treatment for a suicide attempt is clearly \r\nrecorded, but the conditions of that treatment are at odds \r\nwith his statements.  There is no evidence of medical \r\ntreatment for injuries consistent with assault.  The \r\nappellant was under mental stress during service, and such \r\nwas directly evaluated and attributed to family problems.  \r\nThe appellant had substantial time lost during service, which \r\nindicates that the assault could not happen at those times.  \r\nThe appellant's later statements regarding the 1979 shooting \r\nand his reasons for it undermine his credibility.  Having \r\nlooked to the alternative forms of credible supporting \r\nevidence, the preponderance of the evidence is against a \r\nfinding that the appellant's stressors are supported by \r\ncredible evidence.  Thus, service connection is not warranted \r\nfor PTSD.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f), supra.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has also considered the depression and anxiety \r\naspects of the appellant's claim.  In order to establish \r\nservice connection for the claimed disorder, there must be \r\n(1) competent and credible evidence of a current disability; \r\n(2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-\r\nservice incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and \r\n(3) competent and credible evidence of a nexus between the \r\nclaimed in-service disease or injury and the current \r\ndisability.  See Hickson, supra.\r\n\r\nThere is no current evidence of diagnoses of depression or \r\nanxiety or a nexus to service.  The Joint Motion for Remand \r\npoints to medical records from 1995 to suggest that he bore a \r\ndiagnosis of depression at the time he filed the instant \r\nclaim.  \r\n\r\nThe Board considers the question of whether the appellant \r\nbears a diagnosis of depression or anxiety immaterial to the \r\noutcome of this case.  Following the Joint Motion for Remand, \r\nthe appellant was invited to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument in support of his claim.  The appellant submitted \r\nanother statement to the effect that he has a mental \r\ndisability as a result of an inservice assault.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the appellant's statements regarding \r\nthis assault and found them incredible.  As discussed above, \r\nthe appellant's ex-wife indicated that she visited the \r\nappellant in the hospital at Fort Polk, that he was covered \r\nin bruises and that he told her about the assault.  At the \r\ntime of the suicide attempt, which the appellant indicates \r\nwas the time of the assault, the appellant was not treated \r\nfor physical injuries.  In short, the lay evidence of the \r\nassault is not consistent with any other piece of evidence of \r\nrecord and, in many instances, is directly contradicted by \r\nthe remaining record.  The Board finds that there is no \r\ncredible evidence to support a finding of an inservice \r\nassault that would have led to a mental disability.  The \r\nappellant had a session of psychiatric counseling in service \r\nfollowing his suicide attempt, during which he reported being \r\ndepressed, as discussed above.  Importantly, his problems \r\nwere not diagnosed as a depressive or anxiety disorder.  The \r\nBoard is compelled to note that feeling depressed and having \r\na depressive disorder are not the same thing.  Additionally, \r\nthe April 1980 court-ordered psychiatric evaluation \r\ndemonstrates that there was no depressive disorder or anxiety \r\ndisorder diagnosed at that time.  Combined with his service \r\ntreatment records which do not show the presence of a \r\ndepressive or anxiety disorder, there is no medical evidence \r\nto support a finding that he has had such a disorder \r\ncontinuously since service.  The lay evidence regarding \r\ninservice psychiatric disability consists entirely of the \r\nappellant's statements, which the Board has found incredible.  \r\nThe remaining lay evidence, the appellant's ex-wife's \r\nstatement, does not address whether the appellant had \r\nsymptoms of a psychiatric disability during service.  \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the VCAA section and PTSD discussion above, \r\nthere are VA medical records indicating a psychiatric \r\ndisorder related to the alleged service assault; these \r\nreports rely on the appellant's statements.  Because the \r\nBoard finds the appellant's reported history incredible, the \r\nfactual predicate of these records is removed, rendering them \r\ninadequate for ratings purposes.  See Nieves, supra.  Without \r\ncredible evidence of an inservice injury, disease or event \r\nthat could ultimately lead to a depressive or anxiety \r\ndisability and without evidence demonstrating continuity of a \r\ndepressive or anxiety disorder symptomatology since service, \r\nthe Board finds that the appellant did not have either a \r\ndepressive or anxiety disorder during service, has not had \r\neither a depressive or anxiety disorder continuously since \r\nservice and did not suffer an inservice assault to which a \r\npresent depressive or anxiety disorder may be related.  Thus, \r\nservice connection is not warranted.  See Hickson, supra.  \r\n\r\nAs such, the Board finds that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the appellant's claim.  Consequently, the \r\nbenefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must \r\nbe denied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet.

Jackson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from February 1970 to February \r\n1971. \r\n\r\nThis matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a September 2004 rating decision issued by \r\nthe RO, which denied the Veteran's claim for service connection \r\nfor asthma (claimed as lung problems).\r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Board denied the Veteran's claim for \r\nservice connection for a lung disorder.  The Veteran appealed the \r\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claim \r\n(Court).  In July 2009, the Court granted a Joint Motion to \r\nvacate the September 2008 decision and to remand the matter for \r\nfurther development.  In compliance thereof, the Board remanded \r\nthe issue in March 2010 for further development of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All notification and development needed to fairly adjudicate \r\nthe claim on appeal has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n2.  The current lung disorder is not shown to have onset in \r\nservice or otherwise have an etiological relationship to the \r\nVeteran's period of service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA disability manifested by pulmonary fibrosis was not incurred in \r\nor aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1112, 1113, 5103, \r\n5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159, 3.303, \r\n3.304 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA), codified at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, \r\n3.326(a), and as interpreted by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) have been fulfilled by \r\ninformation provided to the Veteran in correspondence from the RO \r\ndated in February 2004 and April 2010.  Those letters notified \r\nthe Veteran of VA's responsibilities in obtaining information to \r\nassist the Veteran in completing his claim and identified the \r\nVeteran's duties in obtaining information and evidence to \r\nsubstantiate his claim.  (See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), \r\n3.159, 3.326(a)), Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 \r\n(2002), Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  See also \r\nMayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103, 110 (2005), reversed on \r\nother grounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006), Dingess/Hartman v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006); Mayfield v. Nicholson \r\n(Mayfield II), 20 Vet. App. 537 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been made aware of the information and evidence \r\nnecessary to substantiate his claim and has been provided \r\nopportunities to submit such evidence.  The RO has properly \r\nprocessed the appeal following the issuance of the required \r\nnotice.  Moreover, all pertinent development has been undertaken, \r\nexaminations have been performed, and all available evidence has \r\nbeen obtained in this case.  Thus, the content of the notice \r\nletters complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) \r\nand 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b).  No further action is necessary for \r\ncompliance with the VCAA.  \r\n\r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, the Court in Dingess/Hartman \r\nfound that the VCAA notice requirements applied to all elements \r\nof a claim.  Notice as to these matters was provided in the April \r\n2010 letter.  The notice requirements pertinent to the issue \r\naddressed in this decision have been met and all identified and \r\nauthorized records relevant to the matter have been requested or \r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nFurther attempts to obtain additional evidence would be futile.  \r\nThe Board finds the available medical evidence is sufficient for \r\nan adequate determination.  There has been substantial compliance \r\nwith all pertinent VA law and regulations and to move forward \r\nwith the claim would not cause any prejudice to the appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws and Regulations\r\n\r\nThe law provides that service connection may be granted to a \r\nveteran for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred \r\nin or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110, 1131 (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304 (2009).  For the showing of \r\nchronic disease in service, there is required a combination of \r\nmanifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and \r\nsufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If \r\nchronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity \r\nof symptoms after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for \r\nany disease diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence \r\nestablishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nAs a general matter, service connection for a disability on the \r\nbasis of the merits of such claim is focused upon (1) the \r\nexistence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the \r\ndisease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus \r\nbetween the current disability and any injury or disease during \r\nservice.  See Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542 (1992); \r\nRabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992). The Federal \r\nCircuit has held that a veteran seeking disability benefits must \r\nestablish the existence of a disability and a connection between \r\nservice and the disability.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2000).                 \r\n\r\nThe Court has held that where the determinative issue involves \r\nmedical causation or a medical diagnosis, competent medical \r\nevidence is required.  Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91 (1993); \r\nsee also Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  The \r\nFederal Circuit has also recognized the Board's \"authority to \r\ndiscount the weight and probity of evidence in light of its own \r\ninherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of \r\nevidence.\"  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. \r\n1997).  VA is free to favor one medical opinion over another \r\nprovided it offers an adequate basis for doing so.  See Owens v. \r\nBrown, 7 Vet. App. 429 (1995).\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad \r\ninterpretation, consistent with the facts in each case with all \r\nreasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant; \r\nhowever, the reasonable doubt rule is not a means for reconciling \r\nactual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.102 (2009).\r\n\r\nFactual Background and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts his lung disorder is due to exposure to \r\nasbestos during his period of service.  The service treatment \r\nrecords do not document any complaints, findings or diagnoses \r\npertaining to a chronic lung disorder.  In a January 1971 \r\npsychiatric outpatient consultation report, it was indicated that \r\nfor eight months prior to entering service, the Veteran worked in \r\na junk yard.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to service, VA treatment records document treatment \r\nthe Veteran received for various disorders, including for a lung \r\ndisorder.  A March 2003 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran \r\nwas seen, in pertinent part, for abnormal chest x-ray findings.  \r\nThere was no angina, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), \r\nbreathing problems, wheezing or hemoptysis.  The Veteran was \r\nprescribed Albuterol, an oral inhaler.  The Veteran related that \r\nhe was a former smoker with a 1 pack per day history for \r\napproximately 3-4 years; however, he quit smoking in 1978.  \r\nObjectively, the lungs were clear to auscultation with no rales, \r\nwheezes or rhonci.  The relevant diagnosis was asthma.\r\n\r\nIn a January 2004 VA treatment record, the Veteran complained of, \r\nin pertinent part, increase in breathing problems with wheezing \r\nand cough productive of dark brown thick sputum.  Remaining \r\nfindings were unchanged from the March 2003 treatment record, \r\nexcept that the Veteran reported he quit smoking 3 weeks ago (he \r\npreviously reported that he stopped smoking in 1978).\r\n\r\nIn a May 2004 VA treatment record, the diagnosis was rule out \r\nasbestos exposure.  The physician indicated the diagnosis was \r\npossibly related to an injury, disease, or event occurring during \r\nthe Veteran's period of military service.\r\n\r\nIn an April 2009 VA pulmonary consultation record, the Veteran \r\ncomplained of shortness of breath ongoing for the past ten years.  \r\nHe became short of breath even with mild exertion.  His shortness \r\nof breath was worse at night causing him to wake up at night \r\ngasping for air and sweating.  His wife reportedly heard crackles \r\nwhen he slept at night.  He did have a cough, productive of brown \r\nsputum (mainly at night), associated with his shortness of \r\nbreath.  He noted that at the end of the day, he had lower limb \r\nswelling.  He had a history of childhood asthma.  The chest was \r\nclear to auscultation and percussion with normal fremitus and \r\npercussion and no evidence of axillary or supraclavicular nodes.  \r\nThe pulmonary function test (PFT) results were noted.  The \r\nimpression was shortness of breath.  The examiner opined that the \r\nshortness of breath was likely cardiac in etiology given that the \r\nVeteran's methacholine challenge test and PFT results were \r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nDuring a June 2010 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he \r\nwas diagnosed with \"asbestos in my left lung\" in approximately \r\n2000.  The condition had gradually worsened and he now required \r\noxygen with exertion and at bedtime.  He did not have sleep \r\napnea.  The Veteran reported that during service, he repaired \r\nsteam lines in the engine rooms aboard ship for approximately 3 \r\nmonths.  At times there were leaks in the piping.  He was \r\nsensitive to pollen but had never been tested for allergens.  He \r\ndid take an antihistamine medication three times per day for \r\nallergy.\r\n\r\nFollowing his discharge from service, he worked as a machinist \r\nfor approximately 41/2 years.  Subsequently he worked repairing \r\nmachinery.  He was not exposed to asbestos in that capacity.  He \r\nhad a one pack per day history of smoking from ages 18-25.  From \r\nthe ages of 25-50 he did not smoke and denied any exposure to \r\nsecond hand smoke. \r\n\r\nHe used oral inhalers and nebulizer daily for his breathing \r\ndifficulties and indicated this treatment offered fair relief of \r\nhis progressively worsening breathing problems.  He had a \r\npositive history of hypertension and dyspnea at rest.  He also \r\nhad a positive history of non-productive cough, wheezing, night \r\nsweats, and slight hemoptysis.  He did not have a history of \r\nproductive cough, non-anginal chest pain, fever, anorexia, \r\nrespiratory failure, cor pulmonale, RVH or pulmonary \r\nhypertension, chronic pulmonary mycosis, sleep apnea, spontaneous \r\npneumothorax, asthma, gunshot wound with retained missile in \r\nlung, pulmonary embolism, or pleurisy with emphysema.  The \r\nVeteran had shortness of breath primarily on exertion but if \r\nexposed to pollens he would become short of breath at rest.  He \r\nbecame short of breath when exposed to steam and potpourri and \r\nsome colognes were irritants that could cause coughing and/or \r\nshortness of breath.  There was also evidence of a mild stroke \r\nwith syncope in November 2009.\r\n\r\nObjectively, he had decreased breath sounds in the right and left \r\nlungs.  He had normal diaphragm excursion and chest expansion.  \r\nThere were no conditions that might be associated with pulmonary \r\nrestrictive disease or deformity of the chest wall.  Chest x-ray \r\nfindings showed old elevation right hemidiaphragm and scarring at \r\nthe right lung base.  PFT were essentially normal.  No \r\nsignificant hilar or mediastinal adenopathy was identified.  No \r\nsignificant pulmonary nodules were seen.  There was evidence of \r\nold granulomatous disease.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis was pulmonary fibrosis.  The disorder affected his \r\noccupational functioning in that the Veteran had to take frequent \r\nbreaks to rest and use his oxygen.  He was not able to use his \r\noxygen when repairing machinery.  The disorder affected his \r\nactivities of daily living in that he could not do any strenuous \r\nchores; he could do limited yard work.\r\n\r\nThe examiner was unable to comment on the previous opinion \r\noffered in May 2004.  In this regard, the examiner commented that \r\nit was unclear whether the previous examiner reviewed the claims \r\nfile or knew the length of the Veteran's service aboard the ship.\r\n\r\nThe examiner indicated the claims had been reviewed and \r\ndocumented the thorough review of the evidence of record.  The \r\nexaminer opined that it was less likely as not (less than 50/50 \r\nprobability) that the Veteran's pulmonary fibrosis was caused by \r\nor a result of military service.  In this regard, the examiner \r\nexplained that the Veteran only served four months aboard a ship \r\nwhile in the Navy.  To that end, he did not have long term \r\nexposure to asbestos fibers.  The examiner explained that \r\nresearch showed that hundreds of factors, including long-term \r\nexposure to toxins and pollutants; chronic exposure to organic \r\nsubstances such as grain dust, sugar cane, or animal droppings; \r\nor, ingestion of certain medications, could cause the lung damage \r\nthat eventually results in pulmonary fibrosis.  However, in most \r\ncases, the cause was never found and the result is idiopathic \r\npulmonary fibrosis.\r\nGiven this review of the record, the Board finds that service \r\nconnection for a lung disorder is not warranted.  The Board \r\nacknowledges the May 2004 VA record indicates that a lung \r\ndisorder was possibly related to an injury, disease, or event \r\noccurring during the Veteran's period of military service.  What \r\nis lacking in that report is a definitive diagnosis of the lung \r\ndisorder and any indication that the claims file, in its \r\nentirety, had been reviewed in conjunction with this \r\ndetermination.  Thus the justification for the May 2004 opinion \r\nis not adequately explained.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, in June 2010, the VA examiner definitively diagnosed \r\nthe Veteran with pulmonary fibrosis and indicated the claims had \r\nbeen reviewed, documenting the thorough review of the evidence of \r\nrecord.  After the thorough review of the claims file, the \r\nexaminer opined that it was less likely as not (less than 50/50 \r\nprobability) that the Veteran's pulmonary fibrosis was caused by \r\nor a result of military service, explaining that the Veteran only \r\nserved four months aboard a ship while in the Navy and thus he \r\ndid not have long term exposure to asbestos fibers.  The examiner \r\nnoted that research showed that hundreds of factors could cause \r\nthe lung damage that eventually results in pulmonary fibrosis; \r\nhowever, in most cases the cause was never found.\r\n\r\nThe Court has held that where the determinative issue involves \r\nmedical causation or a medical diagnosis, competent medical \r\nevidence is required.  Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91 (1993); \r\nsee also Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  The \r\nFederal Circuit has also recognized the Board's \"authority to \r\ndiscount the weight and probity of evidence in light of its own \r\ninherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of \r\nevidence.\"  Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. \r\n1997). VA is free to favor one medical opinion over another \r\nprovided it offers an adequate basis for doing so.  See Owens v. \r\nBrown, 7 Vet. App. 429 (1995).  See also Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 \r\nVet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993) (the probative value of medical \r\nevidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in \r\nanalyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician \r\nreaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight \r\nto be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the \r\nBoard).  In this case, there is no indication that the VA doctor \r\noffering the opinion in May 2004 analyzed the entire record.  \r\nThis defect in the opinion leads the Board to conclude that the \r\nJune 2010 VA examination is the most complete assessment of the \r\nVeteran's lung disorder.  That opinion, that that it was less \r\nlikely as not (less than 50/50 probability) that the Veteran's \r\npulmonary fibrosis was caused by or a result of military service, \r\nwas made after a thorough review of the claims file.  See also \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2009).\r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran is competent to provide testimony or statements \r\nrelating to symptoms or facts of events that he observed and is \r\nwithin the realm of his personal knowledge, he is not competent \r\nto establish that which would require specialized knowledge or \r\ntraining, such as medical expertise.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. \r\n465, 469-70 (1994).  In the present case, medical expertise is \r\nrequired to determine whether any present lung disorder is \r\nrelated to the claimed exposure to asbestos for less than four \r\nmonths during service.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Board finds a basis for awarding service \r\nconnection for a lung disorder has not been established.  The \r\nBoard acknowledges that VA is statutorily required to resolve the \r\nbenefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran when there is an \r\napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding \r\nthe merits of an outstanding issue.  That doctrine, however, is \r\nnot applicable in this case because the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the Veteran's claim.  See Gilbert v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990); 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).  \r\nAccordingly, this appeal is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a lung disorder, to include due to \r\nasbestos exposure is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nREN\ufffdE M.

E. Costas, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran, who is the appellant, served on active duty from \r\nJuly 1965 to July 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal of a March 2005 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Denver, \r\nColorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nA chronic skin rash, variously diagnosed as chronic \r\ndermatitis or dyshydrotic eczema, was not affirmatively shown \r\nto have been present contemporaneously with service; and a \r\nskin rash, variously diagnosed as chronic dermatitis or \r\ndyshydrotic eczema, first documented after separation from \r\nservice, is unrelated to a disease, injury, or event, \r\nincluding exposure to Agent Orange, of service origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA skin rash, variously diagnosed as chronic dermatitis or \r\ndyshydrotic eczema, is not due to disease or injury that was \r\nincurred in or aggravated by service; a skin rash, variously \r\ndiagnosed as chronic dermatitis or dyshydrotic eczema, is not \r\na disease subject to the presumption of service connection \r\ndue to exposure to Agent Orange.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1112, \r\n1116 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2008).\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, codified in part at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A, and \r\nimplemented in part at 38 C.F.R \ufffd 3.159, amended VA's duties \r\nto notify and to assist a claimant in developing information \r\nand evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a), VA must notify the claimant of \r\nthe information and evidence not of record that is necessary \r\nto substantiate a claim, which information and evidence VA \r\nwill obtain, and which information and evidence the claimant \r\nis expected to provide.\r\n\r\nDuty to Notify\r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice must be provided to a claimant before the \r\ninitial unfavorable adjudication by the RO.  Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice requirements apply to all five elements of a \r\nservice connection claim.  The five elements are: 1) Veteran \r\nstatus; 2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection \r\nbetween the Veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree \r\nof disability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  \r\nDingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice was intended to be provided before the \r\ninitial unfavorable adjudication by the RO.  Pelegrini v. \r\nPrincipi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was provided with pre- and post-adjudication VCAA \r\nnotice by letters, dated in October 2004 and May 2006.  The \r\nVeteran was notified of the evidence needed to substantiate \r\nthe claim of service connection, namely, evidence of an \r\ninjury, disease, or event causing an injury or disease during \r\nservice; evidence of current disability; and evidence of a \r\nrelationship between the current disability and the injury, \r\ndisease, or event causing an injury or disease during \r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was notified that VA would obtain service \r\nrecords, VA records, and records of other Federal agencies, \r\nand that he could submit other records not in the custody of \r\na Federal agency such as private medical records, or with his \r\nauthorization VA would obtain any non-Federal records on his \r\nbehalf.  The notice included the general provision for the \r\neffective date of the claim, that is, the date of receipt of \r\nthe claim. \r\n\r\nAs for content of the VCAA notice, the document substantially \r\ncomplies with the specificity requirements of Quartuccio v. \r\nPrincipi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) (identifying evidence to \r\nsubstantiate a claim and the relative duties of VA and the \r\nclaimant to obtain evidence), and of Charles v. Principi, 16 \r\nVet. App. 370 (2002) (identifying the document that satisfies \r\nVCAA notice); of Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 \r\n(2004) (pre-adjudication notice); and of Dingess v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006)(notice of the elements of \r\nthe claim, except for the degree of disability assignable). \r\n\r\nTo the extent that VCAA notice omitted the degree of \r\ndisability assignable, the content of the notice was \r\ndeficient, arguably raising consideration of prejudicial \r\nerror.  As the claim of service connection for a skin rash is \r\ndenied, no disability rating can be assigned as matter of \r\nlaw; therefore there is no possibility of any prejudice to \r\nthe Veteran.  Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F.3d 881 (Fed. Cir. \r\n2007).\r\n\r\nDuty to Assist\r\n\r\nAs required by 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A, VA has made reasonable \r\nefforts to identify and obtain relevant records in support of \r\na claim.  The RO has obtained the service treatment records, \r\nVA treatment records and private medical records.  For the \r\nclaim of service connection for a skin rash, the evidence of \r\nrecord is sufficient to decide the claim.\r\n\r\nAs there is no indication of the existence of additional \r\nevidence to substantiate the claims, the Board concludes that \r\nno further assistance to the Veteran in developing the facts \r\npertinent to the claim is required to comply with the duty to \r\nassist.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nPrinciples of Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.\r\n\r\nService connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, \r\nestablish that a particular injury or disease resulting in \r\ndisability was incurred coincident with service, or if \r\npreexisting such service, was aggravated by service.  This \r\nmay be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or \r\naggravation during service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for disability shown \r\nafter service, when all of the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nA Veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, \r\nserved in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era \r\n(beginning in January 1962 and ending in May 1975) shall be \r\npresumed to have been exposed during such service to \r\nherbicide agents, unless there is affirmative evidence to \r\nestablish that the Veteran was not exposed to any such agent \r\nduring that service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n3.307, 3.309.\r\n\r\nIf a Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active \r\nmilitary service, the following diseases will be presumed to \r\nhave been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable \r\ndegree within specified periods, even if there is no record \r\nof such disease during service: chloracne or other acneform \r\ndisease consistent with chloracne, Type 2 diabetes (also \r\nknown as Type II diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes), \r\nHodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple \r\nmyeloma, \r\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute and subacute peripheral \r\nneuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, \r\nrespiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or \r\ntrachea), and soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, \r\nchondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma).  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).\r\n\r\nThe presumptive period for these conditions is any time after \r\nservice, except that chloracne or other acneform disease \r\nconsistent with chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, and acute \r\nand subacute peripheral neuropathy have a presumptive period \r\nof one year after the last date on which the Veteran was \r\nexposed to an herbicide agent during active service.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e); McCartt \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 164 (1999).\r\n\r\nVA's Secretary has determined that a presumption of service \r\nconnection based on exposure to herbicides used in the \r\nRepublic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era is not warranted \r\nfor any condition for which the Secretary has not \r\nspecifically determined a presumption of service connection \r\nis warranted.  Notice, 59 Fed. Reg. 341, 346 (1994), 61 Fed. \r\nReg. 41,442, 41,449 and 57,586, 57,589 (1996), and 67 Fed. \r\nReg. 42,600, 42,608 (2002).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned provisions relating to \r\npresumptive service connection, which arose out of the \r\nVeteran's Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation \r\nStandards Act, Pub. L. No. 98-542, \ufffd 5, 98 Stat. 2,725, \r\n2,727-29 (1984), and the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Pub. L. \r\nNo. 102-4, \ufffd 2, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), a claimant is not \r\nprecluded from establishing service connection with proof of \r\ndirect causation.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. \r\nCir. 1994).\r\n\r\nFactual Background\r\n\r\nThe service record shows that the Veteran served in Vietnam \r\nfrom October 1966 to May 1968.  \r\n\r\nThe service treatment records show that in November 1966 the \r\nVeteran was treated for a rash, contact dermatitis, in the \r\nleft wrist area.  In May 1967 and March 1968, the Veteran \r\nreceived treatment for a scrotal rash, diagnosed as \r\ntinea/ringworm.  On separation, the Veteran denied having a \r\ncurrent skin disease, the skin evaluation was normal, and no \r\nskin abnormality was listed as a defect or as a diagnosis. \r\n\r\nPost-service, the Veteran has received treatment for skin \r\nrashes, variously diagnosed as chronic dermatitis or \r\ndyshydrotic eczema.  Private treatment records dated in June \r\n2000, reveal treatment for severe dyshydrotic eczema.  At \r\nthat time, the Veteran reported almost a 20 year history of a \r\nskin disorder.  At a June 2003 VA Agent Orange examination, \r\nthe Veteran related a 13 to 16 year history of skin rashes.  \r\nAt that exam, the assessment was a chronic skin rash of \r\nunknown etiology. VA treatment notes from June and August \r\n2004 also reveal treatment for a skin rash, diagnosed as \r\nchronic dermatitis of unknown etiology.  In December and \r\nSeptember 2007, VA records show treatment for chronic \r\ndermatitis possibly due to herbicide exposure.  \r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has a skin rash that is related \r\nto his military service. \r\nService personnel records show that the Veteran's awards and \r\ndecorations included the Vietnam Service Medal.  The Board \r\nacknowledges that where the record indicates that the Veteran \r\nengaged in combat during service, the provisions of \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b) are for application.  Even if it is \r\naccepted that the Veteran contracted a skin disease during \r\ncombat, medical evidence of a nexus to service is still \r\nrequired.  See Wade v. West, 11 Vet. App. 302, 306 (1998); \r\nLibertine v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 521, 522-24 (1996); Gregory \r\nv. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 563, 567 (1996).\r\n\r\nBased on a careful review of the evidence, including the \r\nservice treatment records, we find as a matter of fact that \r\nevidence does not show that chronic dermatitis, dyshydrotic \r\neczema or any other chronic skin disorder was first \r\nmanifested during service.\r\n\r\nThe service treatment records reveal that in November 1966 \r\nthe Veteran was treated for contact dermatitis in the left \r\nwrist area, and that in May 1967 and March 1968 he was \r\ntreated for a ringworm infection in the genital area.  \r\nHowever, at his clinical separation exam, conducted more than \r\none year after his ringworm treatment, his skin was described \r\nas normal, and no dermatologic abnormality was reported as a \r\ndefect or as diagnosis.  \r\n\r\nAfter service, VA records show that in June 2000 the Veteran \r\nreceived treatment for dyshydrotic eczema and he reported a \r\n20 year history of a skin rash, which would date to 1980.  In \r\nJune 2003, the Veteran was diagnosed as having chronic \r\ndermatitis and gave a 13 to 16 year history of a chronic skin \r\nrash, which would date back to at most 1987.  \r\n\r\nThe absence of definite evidence of continuity of symptoms, \r\nwith a complete lack of relevant medical evidence of \r\ntreatment,  from 1968 to 1987 interrupts continuity and is \r\npersuasive evidence against continuity of symptomatology.  \r\nMoreover, the veteran's own account of the history of the \r\ndisorder, dating the onset to 1980 and 1987, militates \r\nagainst his claim.  This is especially so since the 20 year \r\nhistory he related in June 2000 was given for the purposes of \r\ntreatment only.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b); Maxson v. West, 12 \r\nVet. App. 453, 459 (1999), aff'd sub nom.  Maxson v. Gober, \r\n230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (It was proper to \r\nconsider the Veteran's entire medical history, including a \r\nlengthy period of absence of complaints.). \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran stated that he has experienced skin \r\nproblems since service, as fact finder the Board must \r\ndetermine whether the lay evidence is credible.  The Board is \r\nnot holding that corroboration is required, rather the Board \r\ncan weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence \r\nagainst the lay evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F3d \r\n1331 (2006) (absence of medical documentation may go to the \r\ncredibility and weight of Veteran's testimony, but the lack \r\nof such evidence does not, in and of itself, render the lay \r\ntestimony incredible).  Here, the Veteran's assertions of \r\ncontinuity are much less probative than the contemporaneous \r\nrecords during service, that is, three temporally scattered \r\ninstances of treatment with  differing clinical diagnoses, \r\nclinically normal skin at separation, and his self reported \r\ndenial of any skin problem.   Further, there is the absence \r\nof treatment for over two decades by his own report.  \r\nAlthough the evidence shows that the Veteran has an extant \r\nskin disorder, the Boards finds that the more probative \r\nevidence shows that the current skin condition began after \r\nservice. The record not only doesn't support his account, but \r\nactually contradicts it as discussed above.  For these \r\nreasons, the preponderance of the evidence is against the \r\nclaim of service connection for a skin rash on the basis of \r\ncontinuity of symptomatology under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran is competent to describe the features or \r\nsymptoms of a skin condition as they can be capable of lay \r\nobservation, where, as here, the determinative issue involves \r\na question of medical causation, that is, whether the current \r\nskin condition is related to an injury or disease or event of \r\nservice origin, a lay opinion positing a theory about medical \r\ncausation is not competent medical evidence, Grottveit v. \r\nBrown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  \r\n\r\nCompetent medical evidence means evidence provided by a \r\nperson who is qualified through education, training, or \r\nexperience to offer an opinion on medical causation.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.159.  Here, as a lay person the Veteran is not \r\nqualified through education, training, and expertise to offer \r\nan opinion on medical causation.  For this reason, the Board \r\ncannot accept the Veteran's statements as competent evidence \r\nto substantiate the claim of service connection.  Jandreau v. \r\nNicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Since the Board \r\nmay consider only independent medical evidence to support its \r\nfinding as to a question involving medical causation, where a \r\nlay assertion of medical causation is not competent medical \r\nevidence, and as there is no favorable medical evidence of \r\nrecord to support the claim, and in the absence of a possible \r\nassociation with service, a VA examination is not warranted \r\nunder 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4).  \r\n\r\nThe remaining question is whether the current skin disease is \r\nassociated with exposure to herbicides, including Agent \r\nOrange.\r\n\r\nAs the Veteran served in Vietnam during the pertinent time \r\nperiod, it is presumed that he was exposed to herbicides, \r\nincluding Agent Orange.  Neither chronic dermatitis and \r\ndyshydrotic eczema is a disease associated with exposure to \r\nherbicides, including Agent Orange, for which service \r\nconnection on a presumptive basis may be established.  \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is no competent evidence that either \r\nchronic dermatitis or dyshydrotic eczema is actually caused \r\nby exposure to herbicides, including Agent Orange.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(e); Combee \r\nat 34 F.3d 1039.\r\n\r\nAs the Board may consider only independent medical evidence \r\nto support its finding on the question of medical causation, \r\nand as there no such evidence favorable to the claim, we must \r\nconclude that the much greater weight of the evidence is \r\nagainst his claim that he has a skin disorder due to exposure \r\nto Agent Orange, and the benefit-of-the-doubt standard of \r\nproof does not apply.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for skin disease, variously diagnosed as \r\nchronic dermatitis or dyshydrotic eczema, to include as due \r\nto exposure to Agent Orange is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nM.

Barone, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from August 1976 to August 1979 \r\nand from August 1982 to August 1999.\r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\nfrom a rating decision of the Department of Veterans  Affairs \r\n(VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge \r\nat the RO in June 2007.  A transcript of the hearing has been \r\nassociated with the claims file.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal was remanded in October 2007 and October 2009 for \r\nadditional development of the record.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nA left shoulder disability was not manifest in service any \r\ncurrent left shoulder disability is unrelated to service, to \r\ninclude injury therein.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nA left shoulder disability was not incurred in or aggravated \r\nduring service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2002); 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes VA's \r\nduty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for \r\nVA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and \r\n3.326(a) (2010).\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application \r\nfor benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his \r\nrepresentative of any information, and any medical or lay \r\nevidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) (West 2002 & Supp. 2009); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) \r\n(2010); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  Proper \r\nVCAA notice must inform the claimant of any information and \r\nevidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the \r\nclaim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the \r\nclaimant is expected to provide.  VCAA notice should be provided \r\nto a claimant before the initial unfavorable RO decision on a \r\nclaim.  See Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); \r\nMayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005), rev'd on other \r\ngrounds, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 2006, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \r\n(Court) issued a decision in the consolidated appeal of \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), which held \r\nthat the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service \r\nconnection claim.  Those five elements include: 1) Veteran \r\nstatus; 2) existence of a disability; 3) a connection between the \r\nVeteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of disability; \r\nand 5) effective date of the disability.  The Court held that \r\nupon receipt of an application for a service-connection claim, 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) require VA to review \r\nthe information and the evidence presented with the claim and to \r\nprovide the claimant with notice of what information and evidence \r\nnot previously provided, if any, will assist in substantiating or \r\nis necessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as \r\nreasonably contemplated by the application.  Id. at 486.  \r\n\r\nA letter dated in April 2002 discussed the evidence necessary to \r\nestablish service connection.  The Veteran was asked to identify \r\nevidence supportive of his claims.  \r\n\r\nA May 2003 letter discussed the status of the Veteran's claim.  \r\nThe evidence of record was listed and the Veteran was told how VA \r\nwould assist him in obtaining additional relevant evidence.  He \r\nwas again asked to identify evidence supportive of his claims.  \r\n\r\nA July 2006 letter included information regarding the manner in \r\nwhich VA determines disability ratings and effective dates.\r\n\r\nA letter dated in January 2007 listed the evidence of record.  \r\nThe Veteran was asked to submit any evidence pertaining to his \r\nclaim.  The evidence necessary to establish service connection \r\nwas discussed.  \r\n\r\nA November 2007 letter requested that the Veteran submit \r\npertinent evidence that had not been previously considered.  The \r\nevidence of record was listed and the Veteran was told how VA \r\nwould assist him in obtaining further relevant evidence.  A \r\nletter dated in July 2004 discussed the evidence necessary to \r\nestablish service connection.  The evidence of record was listed, \r\nand the Veteran was told how VA would assist him in obtaining \r\nadditional relevant evidence.  The Veteran was advised of the \r\nmanner in which VA determines disability ratings and effective \r\ndates.\r\n\r\nA letter dated in May 1990 advised the Veteran of the evidence \r\nnecessary to establish service connection.  \r\n\r\nIn response to the Veteran's August 2003 claim, he was issued a \r\nletter in August 2003 that discussed the evidence necessary to \r\nsupport a claim for service connection.  He was asked to identify \r\nevidence demonstrating that his claimed conditions existed since \r\nservice.  The evidence of record was listed and the Veteran was \r\ntold how VA would assist him in obtaining additional relevant \r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn August 2010 the Veteran was advised that the Appeals \r\nManagement Center (AMC) would be developing additional evidence \r\nin his appeal.  The status of the appeal was discussed and he was \r\ntold how he could contact the AMC.\r\n\r\nExcept as discussed below, the content of the notice provided to \r\nthe Veteran fully complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) regarding VA's duty to notify.  \r\nThe Veteran has been provided with every opportunity to submit \r\nevidence and argument in support of his claim and to respond to \r\nVA notices.  Further, the Board finds that the purpose behind the \r\nnotice requirement has been satisfied because the Veteran has \r\nbeen afforded a meaningful opportunity to participate effectively \r\nin the processing of his claims.  Therefore, the record reflects \r\nthat he was provided with a meaningful opportunity during the \r\npendency of his appeal such that the preadjudicatory notice error \r\ndid not affect the essential fairness of the adjudication now on \r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not provided with \r\nnotice of the type of evidence necessary to establish a \r\ndisability rating or effective date for the disabilities on \r\nappeal.  However, he was provided with notice of what type of \r\ninformation and evidence was needed to substantiate his claims \r\nfor service connection.  Despite the inadequate notice provided \r\nto the Veteran on these latter two elements, the Board finds no \r\nprejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with the issuance of a \r\nfinal decision.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 \r\n(1993) (where the Board addresses a question that has not been \r\naddressed by the agency of original jurisdiction, the Board must \r\nconsider whether the Veteran has been prejudiced thereby).  In \r\nthat regard, as the Board concludes below that the preponderance \r\nof the evidence is against the appellant's claims for service \r\nconnection, any questions as to the appropriate disability rating \r\nor effective date to be assigned are rendered moot.  The Board \r\nfurther notes that status as a Veteran has never been contested.  \r\nVA has always adjudicated his claims based on his status as a \r\nVeteran as defined by 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.1.\r\n\r\nWith respect to VA's duty to assist, VA and identified treatment \r\nrecords have been obtained and associated with the record.  A VA \r\nexamination has been conducted and an addendum obtained, and the \r\nBoard finds that in combination they are adequate with respect to \r\nthe issue of entitlement to service connection for a left \r\nshoulder disability.  In that regard, the examination was \r\nperformed by a neutral, skilled provider who reviewed the record \r\nand discussed the relevant evidence in rendering his opinion.  \r\nThe Veteran has not otherwise identified any additional evidence \r\nor information which could be obtained to substantiate the claim.  \r\nThe Board is also unaware of any such outstanding evidence or \r\ninformation.  Therefore, the Board is also satisfied that VA has \r\ncomplied with the duty to assist requirements of the VCAA and the \r\nimplementing regulations.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is not prejudicial to the appellant \r\nfor the Board to proceed to a final decision in this appeal.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter the Board notes that the Veteran has not \r\nalleged that the claimed right ankle disability is the result of \r\ncombat service.  Therefore, the combat provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 1154 (West 2002) are not applicable.\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease initially \r\ndiagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that \r\npertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred \r\nin service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to \r\nservice, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  However, \"[a] determination of service \r\nconnection requires a finding of the existence of a current \r\ndisability and a determination of a relationship between that \r\ndisability and an injury or disease incurred in service.\"  Watson \r\nv. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993).\r\n\r\nEntitlement to VA compensation may be granted for disability \r\nresulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by \r\nactive duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110 (wartime service), 1131 \r\n(peacetime service); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  To establish a right to \r\ncompensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: \"(1) \r\nthe existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence \r\nor aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal \r\nrelationship between the present disability and the disease or \r\ninjury incurred or aggravated during service\"-the so-called \r\n\"nexus\" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 \r\n(Fed. Cir. 2004).   \r\n\r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required \r\na combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the \r\ndisease entity, and sufficient observation to establish \r\nchronicity at the time.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  If chronicity in \r\nservice is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms \r\nafter discharge is required to support the claim.  Service \r\nconnection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after \r\ndischarge when all of the evidence establishes that the disease \r\nwas incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService treatment records reflect that on separation from his \r\nfirst period of active service in August 1979, the Veteran denied \r\npainful or trick shoulder.  In May 1986 the Veteran was seen with \r\ncomplaints of left shoulder pain progressing over the previous \r\nthree to four months.  He denied trauma.  Objectively, there was \r\nno redness or edema and range of motion was full with mild \r\napprehension.  There was crepitus and neurosis with notable \r\ndissymmetry.  The assessment was atypical shoulder pain versus \r\nbursitis.  \r\n\r\nIn March 1999 the Veteran complained of left shoulder pain and \r\ndenied specific injury.  The assessment was probably rotator cuff \r\nstrain.  On periodic examination in April 1999 the Veteran \r\nendorsed painful or trick shoulder.  He clarified that he had \r\noccasional left shoulder pain with vigorous exercise.  \r\nClinically, his upper extremities were noted to be normal.  On \r\nretirement examination in July 1999 the Veteran endorsed painful \r\nor trick shoulder.  He reported an injury in 1985.  Clinically, \r\nhis upper extremities were normal.\r\n\r\nAn October 2000 VA treatment record reflects the Veteran's report \r\nof longstanding shoulder pain.  \r\n\r\nOn VA examination in January 2001, the Veteran reported an injury \r\nto his left shoulder while practicing rappelling.  He endorsed \r\noccasional sharp pain on extension of his arm.  Following \r\nphysical examination, the diagnosis was impingement syndrome of \r\nthe left shoulder.  The examiner noted that X-rays showed no \r\nabnormality.  \r\n\r\nDuring a March 2002 psychology consultation, the Veteran reported \r\nthat he had sustained shoulder injuries in helicopter and \r\nrappelling accidents.  \r\n\r\nLay statements dated in July 2006 note the Veteran's complaints \r\nof shoulder pain.\r\n\r\nOn Gulf War protocol examination in October 2006 the Veteran \r\nendorsed shoulder pain.  Following physical examination the \r\nexaminer concluded that the veteran's arthralgias were due to an \r\nunknown etiology.  \r\n\r\nIn a December 2007 statement, the Veteran's VA physician \r\nindicated that the Veteran's shoulder pain had begun with a \r\nrappelling injury 10 years previously.  She stated that the \r\nVeteran had mild to moderate degenerative joint disease in his \r\nshoulder and that the condition had a 50 percent or greater \r\nchance of being related to previous military trauma.\r\n\r\nOn VA examination in June 2009, the Veteran's history was \r\nreviewed.  He reported that he injured his shoulder due to a fall \r\nfrom a rappelling rope, but that he did not seek immediate \r\nmedical attention and that the acute symptoms resolved.  He noted \r\nthat the course of the disability was episodic.  Following \r\nphysical examination, the diagnosis was subacromial bursitis of \r\nthe left shoulder.  The examiner concluded that the condition was \r\nless likely than not caused by or a result of the left shoulder \r\ncondition in service.  She reasoned that the Veteran's current \r\nphysical examination and X-ray studies were consistent with a \r\ndiagnosis of subacromial bursitis.  She noted that there were no \r\nstructural abnormalities or significant muscular deficiencies on \r\nexamination and that therefore, the subacromial bursitis was an \r\noveruse type of injury.  She indicated that potential causative \r\nfactors included deconditioning, muscle imbalance, and \r\nneuromuscular inefficiency and that those factors were all \r\nunrelated to the acute incident in service.\r\n\r\nIn December 2009 the VA examiner provided an addendum to the June \r\n2009 examination report.  She noted that the claims file was \r\nagain reviewed.  She concluded that subacromial bursitis of the \r\nleft shoulder was less likely than not caused by or the result of \r\na left shoulder condition in service.  She reasoned that the \r\nveteran's physical examination in 1986 had no objective findings \r\nconsistent with a well defined anatomic or functional injury such \r\nas rotator cuff tear, tendonitis, or shoulder arthrofibrosis.  \r\nShe noted that the provider's statement of atypical versus \r\nbursitis was a statement outlining a differential, rather than a \r\ndefinitive diagnosis, and that it was thus unclear whether the \r\nVeteran even had bursitis.  She indicated that whether or not \r\nthere was a previous diagnosis of bursitis, it was important to \r\nemphasize that an episode of subacromial bursitis at one point in \r\ntime is not necessarily related to another episode at another \r\npoint unless there was some underlying functional or anatomic \r\nimpairment within the shoulder complex.  She noted that the \r\nVeteran's current and previous physical examination in 1986 did \r\nnot identify any structural deficiency that could explain chronic \r\ninflammation of the bursa that was initiated in 1986 and \r\npersisted.\r\n\r\nUpon careful consideration of the foregoing, the Board has \r\ndetermined that service connection is not warranted for a left \r\nshoulder disability.  In this regard, the Board acknowledges that \r\ncomplaints of shoulder pain were documented in service, and that \r\none assessment indicated atypical shoulder pain versus bursitis.  \r\nHowever, while the Veteran endorsed painful or trick shoulder on \r\nretirement examination in July 1999, his upper extremities were \r\nclinically normal on examination.  Moreover, the June 2009 VA \r\nexaminer concluded in his December 2009 addendum that the current \r\ndiagnosis was less likely than not related to service.  She \r\nstated that whether or not there was a previous diagnosis of \r\nbursitis in service, one episode of subscromial bursitis was not \r\nnecessarily related to a subsequent one unless there was some \r\nunderlying functional or anatomic impairment within the shoulder \r\ncomplex.  She noted that the Veteran's 1986 examination did not \r\nidentify any structural deficiency that could explain chronic \r\ninflammation of the bursa that was initiated in service and \r\npersisted.  The Board notes that the examiner reviewed the claims \r\nfile, including the service medical records, and discussed the \r\nrelevant findings and the underlying rationale for her \r\nconclusions.  There is no indication that the examiner was not \r\nfully aware of the Veteran's medical history or that she \r\nmisstated any relevant fact.  Therefore, the Board finds the \r\nreport of the June 2009 and the December 2009 addendum \r\nexamination to be of great probative value regarding the \r\nVeteran's claimed left shoulder disability.\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the Veteran's statements as to the \r\netiology of this disability and notes that he is certainly \r\ncompetent to report symptomatology and when it occurred.  In \r\naddition, his reports are corroborated in this instance by the \r\nnumerous complaints noted in his service treatment records.  \r\nHowever, even where a Veteran asserted continuity of \r\nsymptomatology since service, he is not necessarily competent to \r\nestablish a nexus between the continuous symptomatology and a \r\ncurrent claimed condition.  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. \r\n488, 495- 98 (1997); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d \r\n1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (explaining in footnote 4 that a Veteran is \r\ncompetent to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a \r\nbroken leg, but not competent to provide evidence as to more \r\ncomplex medical questions).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, competence and credibility are separate matters which \r\nmust be addressed.  As noted by the Federal Circuit in Buchanan, \r\nthe Board has considered the lay statements by the Veteran to VA \r\nand to medical professionals.  The Veteran has presented \r\nconflicting statements regarding onset and etiology of his left \r\nshoulder disability.  In that regard, the Board notes that when \r\nhe was seen for left shoulder complaints in service, he denied \r\nspecific trauma or injury.  It was not until he sought disability \r\nbenefits that he asserted that he suffered injuries in helicopter \r\nand rappelling accidents in service.  Again, the Board notes that \r\nthe Veteran is competent to report that he had pain and other \r\nsymptoms in service and that such continued post service.  The \r\nBoard also again acknowledeges that some shoulder complaints in \r\nservice are documented.  However, his statements regarding the \r\ncircumstances surrounding the onset of his complaints are \r\nunreliable and not credible in that his revised history is \r\ninconsistent with past statements and inconsistent with prior \r\nmedical evidence.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are in \r\nlarge part unreliable and not credible, and, consequently, his \r\nlay assertions are far outweighed by the opinion of the competent \r\nhealth care provider discussed above.  As noted, the VA examiner \r\nconsidered the Veteran's lay reports and his complaints during \r\nservice, but also relied on the documented medical record, and \r\nultimately concluded that this claimed disability is not related \r\nto service.  The Board finds that the opinion of the June 2009 VA \r\nexaminer and her subsequent December 2009 addendum are the most \r\nprobative evidence of record as to a relationship between the \r\nclaimed disability and service, and it outweighs the assertions \r\nof a continuity of symptomatology since service.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Board has considered the record and the Veteran's \r\nassertions, and the Board finds that the preponderance of the \r\nevidence is against the claims of entitlement to service \r\nconnection.  Consequently, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is \r\nnot applicable in the instant appeal.  38 U.S.C.A \ufffd 5107(b); 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd  3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.

Seay, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from October 1963 to October 1966. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2006 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Louis, Missouri.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2011, the Board sought an advisory medical opinion from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7109; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.901(a) (2011).  The opinion, dated in September 2011, has been received and associated with the Veteran's claims file.  In November 2011, a copy of the medical opinion was provided to the Veteran and his representative, and they were offered the opportunity to present additional evidence or argument.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.903 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All relevant evidence necessary for an equitable disposition of the Veteran's appeal has been obtained.\r\n\r\n2.  Multiple sclerosis did not have its onset in active service or become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within seven years after the date of separation from such service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nMultiple sclerosis was not incurred in active service and may not be presumed to have been so incurred.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1110, 1131, 1137, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVA's Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a substantially complete application for benefits, VA must notify the claimant what information or evidence is needed in order to substantiate the claim and it must assist the claimant by making reasonable efforts to get the evidence needed.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b); see Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).  The notice required must be provided to the claimant before the initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA benefits, and it must (1) inform the claimant about the information and evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) inform the claimant about the information and evidence that VA will seek to provide; and (3) inform the claimant about the information and evidence the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120 (2004).\r\n\r\nThe notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection claim.  Those five elements include: 1) Veteran status; 2) existence of a disability; 3) a connection between the Veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Upon receipt of an application for a service-connection claim, 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) require VA to review the information and the evidence presented with the claim and to provide the claimant with notice of what information and evidence not previously provided, if any, will assist in substantiating or is necessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as reasonably contemplated by the application.  Additionally, this notice must include notice that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that VA's duty to notify was satisfied by a letter sent to the Veteran in April 2006 with regard to the claim for service connection for multiple sclerosis.  The letter addressed all of the notice elements and was sent prior to the initial unfavorable decision by the AOJ in August 2006.  Therefore, the duty to notify has been satisfied.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the duty to assist the Veteran has also been satisfied in this case.  The service treatment records and VA treatment records were obtained in connection with the Veteran's case and reviewed by both the RO and the Board.  VA also has a duty to request medical records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) when it has actual notice a veteran is in receipt of disability compensation.  See Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363 (1992).  In this case, during a treatment visit, the Veteran reported receiving disability since 1988.  However, the December 2000 inquiry of the SSA database by the RO indicated that the Veteran receives Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), but did not disclose any evidence of disability compensation.  As the SSA database does not indicate the receipt of disability benefits and the Veteran and his representative have never asserted the receipt of SSA disability benefits, the Board concludes that the notation was a miscommunication.   Given the foregoing, attempts to procure any such records are not required by the duty to assist.  See id; see also Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1321 (2010) (there is no duty to get SSA records when there is no evidence that they are relevant).\r\n\r\nIn addition, pursuant to the December 2009 remand directives, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2010.  Concerning this, when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The Board acknowledges that the January 2010 VA examiner did not provide an adequate nexus opinion.  Therefore, the Board requested an advisory medical opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's multiple sclerosis.  The examiner reviewed the claims file, addressed the questions posed by the Board, and provided a medical opinion with supporting rationale.  Therefore, the Board's remand directive has been completed.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  For these reasons, the Board concludes that VA has fulfilled the duty to assist the Veteran in this case.\r\n\r\nThe Board concludes the Veteran was provided the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the adjudication of his claim and did in fact participate.  Washington v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 191 (2007).  Hence, there is no error or issue that precludes the Board from addressing the merits of this appeal.\r\n\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nIn relevant part, 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 1154(a) requires that the VA give 'due consideration' to 'all pertinent medical and lay evidence' in evaluating a claim to disability benefits.  Generally, in order to establish direct service connection for a disorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of the current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of the in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999)).  However, medical evidence of a current disability and nexus is not always required to establish service connection.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nCompetent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.  Competent medical evidence may also mean statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises.  It would also include statements contained in authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(1).  Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(2).\r\n\r\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  The former is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the latter is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  See Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) ('Although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify.').\r\n\r\nIn addition, the law provides that, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active military service, and multiple sclerosis becomes manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within seven years after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  Id.\r\n\r\nDorland's Medical Dictionary defines multiple sclerosis as a chronic neurologic disease in which there are patches of demyelination scattered throughout the white matter of the central nervous system, sometimes extending into the gray matter, with symptoms including weakness, incoordination, paresthesias, speech disturbances, and visual disturbances, most commonly double vision.  The course of the disease is usually prolonged, with remissions and relapses over many years.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 973 (30th ed. 2003).\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for multiple sclerosis.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran has a current disability.  The VA treatment records reveal that the Veteran was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988.  \r\n\r\nThe service treatment records are absent for any diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and are negative for any of the Veteran's reported symptoms including fatigue, erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, incontinence, and weakness in the extremities.  A May 1964 service treatment record shows that the Veteran complained of headaches and blurred vision.  However, the Veteran was seen six days later and there were no complaints noted.  The subsequent treatment records do not reveal any chronic complaints.  The Veteran was also diagnosed with herpes zoster type rash, left upper quadrant of abdomen.  The September 1966 separation examination report shows that the Veteran's lower extremities were clinically evaluated as normal, the eyes were clinically evaluated as normal, the neurologic condition was clinically evaluated as normal, and the genitourinary system was clinically evaluated as normal.  In the September 1966 report of medical history, the Veteran denied experiencing foot trouble and paralysis.  He also denied experiencing any eye trouble, frequent or painful urination, and neuritis.  He did not report any fatigue, erectile dysfunction, or weakness.  \r\n\r\nThe first documentary evidence of complaints related to multiple sclerosis is dated in the 1980s, more than 13 years after the Veteran's separation from active service.  Specifically, the Veteran was seen in July 1986 when he complained of mild weakness of the lower extremities.  He was able to walk and did not take sick leave.  He had a spontaneous recovery.  In January 1988, the Veteran suffered an exacerbation similar to the symptoms in 1986 with very limited walking.  He had double incontinence and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report was consistent with multiple sclerosis.  The VA treatment records show that the Veteran took steroids from 1988 to 1991 to treat his multiple sclerosis.  The VA treatment records then reveal complaints of significant fatigue, numbness, and erectile dysfunction.  The September 2000 VA treatment record shows that the Veteran likely had relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis (\"RRMS\") with a benign course for 8 years.  The examining physician commented that the symptoms/signs were due to cerebral/spinal lesions.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2010.  The examiner reviewed the Veteran's VA treatment records.  The Veteran reported that he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988 but that early in the 1970s, he started having problems walking.  He was dragging his feet and had occasional falls.  Right after 1969, when he got married, he said that he started having problems voiding his urine.  He denied any vision symptoms.  He reported that, in the early 1980s, he started having sexual dysfunction, and he no longer had erections.  The numbness in both feet started in the 1970s, and the Veteran started using a scooter in 1990 because of weakness and stumbles.  He noticed some increasing weakness since the 1970s.  He had bowel incontinence going back to the 1970s.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran presented with tingling in his body when he was in the swimming pool.  He was still unable to empty fully his bladder.  He was unable to walk for long distances.  He was able to take a few steps.  He presented with numbness in both hands and both feet and both legs.  The examiner commented that the cause of multiple sclerosis was unknown but tissue damage and neurological symptoms were the result of an immune mechanism directed against myelin antigens.  The examiner further noted that viral infection or other inciting factors might produce these changes.  Clinically it is defined by involvements of different parts of the central nervous system at different times.  The Veteran developed symptoms long after being discharged from service and never mentioned the time that he was affected by herpes virus while in service.  The examiner did not think that the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was related to any virus syndrome that the Veteran suffered while in the service.  It was clear that the Veteran has probable multiple sclerosis, but there was no correlation with any viral syndrome that the Veteran might have had in the past.  In a February 2010 addendum to the examination report, the examiner noted that the claims file had been reviewed.  On April 16, 1966, the Veteran was seen by the medical officers, and there was a note in the claims file that stated that the Veteran had a herpes zoster type rash on the left upper quadrant of abdomen.  The examiner noted that multiple sclerosis was not caused by or a result of a herpes infection.  There was no medical evidence that multiple sclerosis is etiologically related to a virus infection.  The Veteran developed neurological symptoms 20 years after being discharged from active duty.  When he was in the military, the Veteran checked no as to whether he experienced any nervous trouble of any sort.  The examiner felt it was not likely at all that the multiple sclerosis was caused by a virus infection.  \r\n\r\nThe Board requested an expert medical opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's multiple sclerosis.  The examiner reviewed the pertinent medical records and noted that the question presented was whether the Veteran's current diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was causally or etiologically related to the period of active service.  The examiner observed that, while in service in May 1964, the Veteran complained of headaches and blurred vision with reading.  These symptoms were nonspecific and inconclusive since no other details were available.  Per medical records, the Veteran was seen six days later, and there were no complaints noted.  In June 1966, the Veteran was diagnosed with herpes zoster type rash, left upper quadrant of abdomen, and again the Veteran had no neurological complaints at that time or after that time while in service.  The Veteran was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988, and the examiner noted that since then he had had gait problems; he also had a history of neurogenic bladder.  In July 1986, the Veteran had complaints of weakness and numbness in both lower extremities.  Per medical chart, the complaints resolved and recurred in January 1988, when the Veteran had significant gait problems and incontinence bladder, treated with I.V. steroids.  The Veteran had an MRI of the brain in 2000, which reported frontal, parietal and occipital white matter lesions compatible with multiple sclerosis.  The examniner noted that multiple sclerosis is widely accepted as an inflammatory auto-immune disorder; that it is a complex multifactorial disease; and that the cause of multiple sclerosis is not known.  The examiner further stated that the only virus suggested as a possible risk factor in multiple sclerosis and consistently implicated is Epstein Barr virus but that this is not confirmed and needs further study.  After review of the Veteran's chart, the examiner did not find sufficient documented medical evidence to indicate that the Veteran's current diagnosis of multiple sclerosis since 1988 was causally or etiologically related to his period of active service.  The examiner did not think the Veteran's herpes zoster infection in 1966, while in the military service, caused his multiple sclerosis.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the Veteran's assertions that his multiple sclerosis is related to active service.  The Board acknowledges that lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994) (noting that lay evidence is competent with regard to facts perceived through the use of the five senses and cautioning that lay testimony that veteran suffered a particular illness, bronchial asthma, was not competent because matter required medical expertise); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995) (noting that veteran's statements were competent to describe the observable flatness of his feet); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) (finding veteran competent to testify to ringing in the ears (tinnitus) which is capable of lay observation); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, Note 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that sometimes a layperson will be competent to identify a medical condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer, and remanding to the Court to remand to the Board to decide whether lay evidence was competent and sufficient to establish a shoulder dislocation); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet App 303, 308-09 (2007) (holding that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of varicose veins); cf. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (noting that, unlike varicose veins or a dislocated shoulder, rheumatic fever is not a condition capable of lay diagnosis).\r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran may be competent to describe symptoms of multiple sclerosis, he is not competent to comment on the etiology of such a disorder.  While a layperson can provide evidence as to some questions of etiology or diagnosis, the question of a medical relationship between multiple sclerosis and service, which would require more than direct observation to resolve, is not in the category of questions that lend themselves to resolution by lay observation.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007), Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007), Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  Therefore, the Veteran's statements asserting a relationship between his multiple sclerosis and service do not constitute competent medical evidence on which the Board can make a service connection determination.  Moreover, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence with respect to the etiology of the Veteran's current multiple sclerosis is the September 2011 expert medical opinion.  The examiner has medical expertise and provided supporting rationale for the medical opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Board also acknowledges the Veteran's argument that his herpes infection during active service caused his multiple sclerosis.  In support of his argument, he submitted two articles suggesting that there may be a link between human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and those diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  It was noted that additional testing was underway.  The article explained that HHV-6 is known to be present in 90 percent of the adult American population as a result of infection during the first few years of life.  \r\n\r\nMedical treatise evidence can, in some circumstances, constitute competent medical evidence.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 514 (1998); see also 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(1) (competent medical evidence may include statements contained in authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and research reports and analyses).  Similarly, medical treatise evidence could \"discuss [] generic relationships with a degree of certainty such that, under the facts of a specific case, there is at least a plausible causality based upon objective facts.\"  Mattern v. West, 12 Vet. App. 222, 229 (1999); Sacks v. West, 11 Vet. App. 314, 317 (1998), Libertine v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 521 (1996); Beausoleil v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 459 (1996).  However, the Internet articles submitted by the Veteran are of a general nature.  Although the articles suggest that there may be a link between HHV-6 and the development of multiple sclerosis, it does not discuss a rash of herpes zoster that the Veteran experienced during service.  Moreover, the articles noted that additional testing was underway to explore whether such a link exists.  Medical evidence that is speculative, general or inconclusive in nature cannot support a claim.  See generally Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993); Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, 611 (1992).  Here, there is no medical evidence relating the Veteran's multiple sclerosis to a herpes zoster rash in service.  The expert medical opinion addressed the Veteran's contention; the examiner reviewed the claims file and explained that he did not think that the Veteran's herpes zoster rash in 1966, while in the military service caused his multiple sclerosis.  The Board finds that the examiner's opinion is more persuasive than that of the articles and the Veteran's statements.  As noted above, the examiner has medical expertise, provided supporting rationale for the opinion provided, citing to the medical evidence reviewed.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also recognizes that service connection may be granted on the basis of continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  In this case, the Veteran has contended that he has experienced erectile dysfunction, chronic fatigue, neurogenic bladder, incontinence, and weakness in the lower extremities since active service.  The Board recognizes that the Veteran can attest to factual matters of which he had first-hand knowledge.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005).  Furthermore, he can attest to symptoms such as chronic fatigue, erectile dysfunction, and weakness in the lower extremities.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  \r\n\r\nHowever, in this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible with respect to the onset of his reported symptoms.  Concerning the credibility of the evidence, \"definitions of credibility do not necessarily confine that concept to the narrow peg of truthfulness.  It has been termed as 'the quality or power of inspiring belief. . . .'  Credibility . . . apprehends the over-all evaluation of testimony in the light of its rationality or internal consistency and the manner in which it hangs together with other evidence.\"  Indiana Metal Prods. v. NLRB, 442 F.2d 46, 51-52 (7th Cir. 1971) (citations omitted).  In this case, medical opinion that multiple sclerosis did not have its onset in service and is not related to a virus in service \"hangs together\" in a consistent manner with the other evidence of record and renders it more believable and convincing.\r\nThe Board attributes more value to that of the documentary medical evidence of record.  Indeed, the service treatment records are completely absent for any complaints or documentation of chronic fatigue, weakness, or erectile dysfunction.  The Board finds it highly unlikely that the Veteran would be suffering from these symptoms, particularly chronic fatigue, and be able to perform his military duties including physical training.  In fact, in a provided history of the Veteran's multiple sclerosis in the VA treatment records, it was only noted that the Veteran began experiencing possible symptoms in the 1980s.  Specifically, the Veteran sought treatment in 1986 for mild weakness/numbness in the lower extremities with no sphincter problems.   The Veteran was then diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988 with symptoms of weakness in the extremities, bladder problems, and incontinence.  He later appeared to develop fatigue and erectile dysfunction.  Although he appears to be sincere in his belief as to service connection, in light of these factors, the Veteran's current statements to the effect that he has experienced continuous symptomatology since active service, while competent, are not deemed to be credible.  The absence of documented complaints or treatment for many years following his military discharge is more probative than his current recollection as to symptoms experienced in the distant past.  See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59 (1994).  Thus, the Board finds that service connection based on continuity of symptomatology is not warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board also finds that the weight of the evidence is against a grant of service connection for multiple sclerosis on a presumptive basis.  Specifically, the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the disease manifested to a compensable degree within 7 years of the Veteran's separation from service in 1966.  The Board recognizes the Veteran's statements regarding symptoms that have been present since service including chronic fatigue, weakness in his extremities, erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, and incontinence.  As stated above, the Veteran is competent to express that he has experienced such symptoms.  See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  However, the Board finds that the Veteran is not credible with respect to the onset of his reported symptoms.  Again, the service treatment records do not reveal any complaints related to chronic fatigue, weakness of the extremities, erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, or incontinence.  The post-service treatment records show that the Veteran did not seek any treatment until the 1980s when he only complained of mild weakness in the lower extremities.  When he was treated in 1986 regarding his complaint of weakness of the extremities, he did not report experiencing any fatigue, erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, or incontinence.  The Veteran was not seen again until 1988, when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  At that time, the Veteran then reported experiencing bladder and bowel problems.  In records dated subsequent to his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, the Veteran reported experiencing fatigue and erectile dysfunction.  The Board affords more credence to the documentary evidence of record rather than the Veteran's current statements, located in the January 2010 VA examination report, regarding the onset of the symptoms.  As noted above, the VA treatment record documenting the history of the Veteran's multiple sclerosis only noted that the Veteran reported experiencing mild weakness in his extremities in the 1980s, more than 13 years after the Veteran's separation from active duty.  Such history reported by the Veteran for treatment purposes are found by the Board to be of more probative value than the more recent assertions and histories given for VA disability compensation purposes by the Veteran and the lay statements he has submitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1997) (lay statements found in medical records when medical treatment was being rendered may be afforded greater probative value; statements made to physicians for purposes of diagnosis and treatment are exceptionally trustworthy because the declarant has a strong motive to tell the truth in order to receive proper care).  In summary, the Board has weighed the lay and medical evidence of record and finds that the lay evidence of multiple sclerosis symptoms during service or as early as the 1970s are of lesser probative value than the medical evidence that contains statements the Veteran made for treatment purposes, which reflect that his symptoms began in the 1980s.  Because multiple sclerosis is not shown to be manifested during the applicable seven year presumptive period, presumptive service connection is not warranted for multiple sclerosis as a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for the reasons and bases set forth above, the Board finds the preponderance of the evidence of record is against the grant of service connection for multiple sclerosis.  Because the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt provision does not apply.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that service connection for multiple sclerosis is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for multiple sclerosis is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nKATHLEEN K.

The Veteran is not shown to have had duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam during his period of active military service. \r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran is not shown to have been exposed to an herbicide agent during active military duty. \r\n\r\n3.  The Veteran does not have diabetes mellitus that is related to his military service. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran does not have diabetes mellitus that is the result of disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active military service; nor may it be presumed to have been incurred therein.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1110, 1112, 1116, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102 , 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2011). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1966 to April 1969.  He is seeking service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II.  The Veteran alleges that his diabetes mellitus is the result of herbicide exposure in service.  \r\n\r\nA review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) is negative for evidence of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus during his military service.  The STRs do not record abnormal findings for urinalysis tests conducted with examinations in January 1966, March 1967 or March 1969.  The Veteran's personnel records reflect that he was stationed at Subic Bay, Philippines, from April 1967 to October 1968.  He was assigned as a supply administrative clerk at the Headquarters Company of the Marine Barracks at Subic Bay.  The records do not reflect any temporary duty outside of the Philippines to any destination.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran alleges that he had herbicide exposure as a result of the shipment of Agent Orange through the United States military facility at Subic Bay.  In particular, the Veteran has provided information of alleged shipments of Agent Orange by the government of New Zealand that were sent to Vietnam via Subic Bay.  (The information is by way of an Internet article and not an official government publication or report.)\r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted his initial claim for VA disability compensation benefits in January 1996.  He sought service connection for several issues related to a motorcycle accident that he had while stationed in the Philippines in 1967.\r\n\r\nMedical records developed for that claim included private medical records dating from April 1969 to November 1994.  The records do not contain a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.  The Veteran had surgery on his left knee in July 1986.  Laboratory studies at that time were negative for glucose in the urine and the blood sample showed a glucose reading of 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) with a normal value being from 70 to 110 according to the report.  \r\n\r\nAlso of record were VA treatment records dated from February 1996 to March 1996.  The Veteran was noted to have an elevated glucose value on a blood test done in February 1996.  However, a follow-on outpatient note recorded that the Veteran had not fasted prior to his test and this had resulted in the elevated reading.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted his current claim in February 2009.  He reported receiving a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II from VA in 2005.\r\n\r\nVA outpatient records for the period from June 2005 to June 2009 were obtained.  The records document the Veteran as having an elevated hemoglobin (H) A1C value as well as an elevated glucose value in May 2005.  An entry from July 2005 had a problem list that listed diabetes mellitus without mention of complication, type II or unspecified type.  An entry from November 2006 provided a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II.  It was said to be under control by diet and exercise.  Later treatment entries related to monitoring the Veteran's diabetes.  There was no mention of etiology of the diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) wrote to the Veteran and asked that he provide details on his alleged exposure to herbicides in February 2009.  He responded in March 2009 that the government of New Zealand had shipped Agent Orange to a magazine at Cubi Point in the Philippines.  He said he exposed as a result of visiting Cubi Point several times during his tour of duty at Subic Bay.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ contacted the Veterans Benefits Administration Central Office, Compensation and Pension (C&P) Service, for confirmation of whether Agent Orange was stored at Cubi Point as allowed for by M21-1MR, IV.ii.2.C.10.o.  A response was provided in May 2009.  The C&P response noted that the Department of Defense (DoD) had not provided information of the presence of Agent Orange, by shipment or usage, at Subic Bay or in the Philippines.  Moreover, there was no information regarding the shipment of such chemicals by the government of New Zealand, especially in light of the fact that New Zealand was not involved in the Vietnam herbicide spraying operation.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the C&P Service could not corroborate the Veteran's allegation, it was recommended for the AOJ to follow the procedure listed in the M21-1MR, as referenced above.  This would involve sending a request for information to the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC).  It was noted that the AOJ should provide the JSRRC with the Veteran's military unit, location, dates at the location, military occupation, and other relevant facts as shown by the Veteran's actual personnel records.  The cited M21-1MR provision provides this guidance for claims involving herbicide exposure in locations other than the Republic of Vietnam or Korea.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ denied the claim in July 2009.  The rating decision noted that the Veteran had not served in Vietnam.  Further, the evidence of record did not establish the use or storage of Agent Orange in the Philippines at any time.  Moreover, there was no indication that the government of New Zealand had any involvement in shipping chemicals related to Agent Orange as they were not involved in the spraying process.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted his notice of disagreement (NOD) in August 2009.  He included a copy of any article from the Internet, which reported that New Zealand confirmed that that it had supplied Agent Orange during the war in Vietnam.  The article cited a government official as saying that information provided to that official indicated that \"products used to make Agent Orange\" were shipped from New Plymouth (New Zealand) to Subic Bay in the 1960s.  The article was first published in January 2005.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran also submitted a copy of a newsletter obtained from an Internet site known as Subic Bay Marines.  This was the January 2009 newsletter.  The newsletter contained a number of articles.  Several addressed issues such as Gulf War Syndrome and water problems at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina.  Of particular note was a short article that said that, over the last several years, it had been said that Subic Bay Marines \"may have\" been exposed to Agent Orange while in Subic Bay.  The article pointed to the then-recent admission by the government of New Zealand.  The article referenced another article in the newsletter on how to apply for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure.  The Veteran submitted a copy of the June 2009 edition of the newsletter.  The newsletter referenced the publication of a prior edition in September 2007 that addressed the shipping of chemicals from New Zealand to Subic Bay.  The specific website used by the Veteran to get his information on the chemicals was listed in the 2007 newsletter.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ did not initially conduct the additional research as noted by the C&P Service.  The Board remanded the case for the AOJ to conduct the development in October 2010.  \r\n\r\nThe AOJ wrote to the Veteran in October 2010.  He was asked to provide specific information regarding his alleged exposure to herbicides.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran responded by submitting duplicate copies of the material supplied with his NOD.  He also said his material said chemicals were stored at the Cubi Point magazine.  He said his contact with the chemicals was incidental.  He had a motorcycle and rode from base to base during his service in the Philippines.  The Veteran also said that he did not know that he had diabetes mellitus, type II until about 5 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe AOJ submitted an electronic query for information regarding the possible storage and/or use of herbicides, specifically, Agent Orange, during the Veteran's 18-month period of service in the Philippines in January 2011.  The request was made through the Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System (DPRIS).  The response was that a review was made of DoD records.  The review showed that Agent Orange, or other tactical herbicides, were not used, tested, disposed of or stored in Subic Bay or anywhere else in the Philippines during 1967.  \r\n\r\nThe AOJ, relying on the above information, confirmed the denial of the Veteran's claim in October 2011.  The Veteran was issued a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) that same month.  The Veteran responded that he had no additional evidence or information to submit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  Generally, service connection requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability, (2) medical evidence, or in certain circumstances lay testimony, of in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  Further, it is not enough that an injury or disease occurred in service; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if diabetes mellitus is shown to have been manifested to a compensable degree within one year of qualifying active military service, it may be presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a), 3.309(a) (2011).  \r\n\r\nAlso, a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962 and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  If a veteran was exposed to an \"herbicide agent\" during active military, naval, or air service or is presumed to have been so exposed, certain diseases, including type II diabetes mellitus, are presumed to be incurred in or aggravated by service if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307(a)(6) are met, even though there is no record of the disease during service, provided that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307(d) are also satisfied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(e).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the Veteran's claim fails on a presumptive basis for exposure to herbicides because no evidence of record establishes that the Veteran had actual duty or visitation in Vietnam.  Further, the Veteran does not allege he was exposed based on such service.  Service connection, on a presumptive basis due to exposure in Vietnam, is denied.   \r\n\r\nBased on the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection on a direct basis for type II diabetes mellitus is also not warranted.  Although there is medical evidence of a current disability, there is no medical evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of diabetes.  The STRs show no diagnosis or treatment related to diabetes, and the Veteran's in-service examinations are negative for diabetes.  Moreover, there is no showing of continuity of symptomatology after service, as the record shows that the Veteran has not claimed such a continuity and he was not diagnosed with diabetes until many years after leaving service.  The Board finds that the absence of documented diabetes mellitus until approximately 36 years after discharge, weighs heavily against the claim.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (it is proper to consider a veteran's entire medical history, including a lengthy period of absence of complaints); see also Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\"negative evidence\" could be considered in weighing the evidence).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Veteran has not contended that the disease began in service.  Rather, he asserts that he is entitled to a presumption of service incurrence on account of in-service herbicide exposure.  Significantly, the query of official records through DPRIS was unable to find any evidence to substantiate the use, testing, disposal of, or storage of Agent Orange or other tactical herbicides in Subic Bay or anywhere else in the Philippines during all of 1967.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not established the actual existence of Agent Orange in any area where he was stationed in the Philippines.  The one article he submitted, and apparently the only article ever relied on by the Subic Bay Marine newsletter over several years, is a media article and not an official government report.  Additionally, the Veteran's claimed exposure is based on his riding a motorcycle from base to base and not any direct exposure.  The Board finds the official response through DPRIS to be more probative in regard to the core issue of the actual presence of Agent Orange or other herbicides being located at Subic Bay or Cubi Point or any other location in the Philippines during the Veteran's service.  The report is negative in that regard.\r\n\r\nThus, the evidence does not establish that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides in service.  His claim for service connection on a direct basis is denied.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, because diabetes was not shown until many years after military service, it may not be presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307(a), 3.309(a) (2011).  The preponderance of the evidence is against service connection for the claim on a one-year presumptive basis.\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp 2011)), and the pertinent implementing regulation, codified at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2011), provides that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.  They also require VA to notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the Secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Court has held that the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection claim.  Those five elements include: 1) veteran status; 2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted his claim for benefits in February 2009.  The AOJ wrote to him that same month with notice on how to substantiate his claim.  In particular, he was asked to provide information regarding his claimed exposure to Agent Orange/herbicides.  The letter further provided Dingess notice on how effective dates and disability ratings are determined.  The Veteran responded that he had no additional information or evidence to submit in March 2009.  He did provide information on his alleged exposure.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim was denied in July 2009.  He submitted his NOD in August 2009.  It was at this time he provided his evidence to support his contention that he was exposed during his service in the Philippines.  The Veteran perfected his appeal in March 2010.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not disputed the contents of the VCAA notice in this case.  He was afforded a meaningful opportunity to participate in the development of his claim.  From the outset, he demonstrated actual knowledge of what was required to establish service connection as evidenced by his statements and theory of exposure, the submission of evidence he believed supported his claim as well as identifying evidence for VA to obtain.  There is no evidence of prejudice to the Veteran based on any notice deficiency and he has not alleged any prejudice.  Thus, the Board is satisfied that the duty to notify requirements under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) were satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that VA has adequately fulfilled its obligation to assist the Veteran in obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim.  All available evidence pertaining to the Veteran's claim has been obtained.  The evidence includes his STRs, information from DPRIS, VA and private treatment records, as well as evidence regarding possible storage of Agent Orange in the Philippines.  The Veteran declined to have a hearing in his case.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was not afforded an examination in regard to his claim.  However, in light of the Board's determination that the evidence does not support his exposure to herbicides in service, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus made approximately 36 years after service, and because there is no other evidence of a nexus to service aside from the Veteran's allegation of exposure to herbicides, there is no requirement to obtain an examination in this case.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006); see also Wells v. Principi, 326 F.3d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (a veteran is required to show some causal connection between his disability and his military service).  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty to notify and assist.  The Veteran has not identified any other pertinent evidence, not already of record.  The Board is also unaware of any such evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nMARK F.

DeFrank, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1957 to July 1977. \r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2005 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIn September 2010 and September 2011, the Board remanded this issue for additional development.  The requested development has been completed, and the case has been returned to the Board for further appellate action.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, in addition to the paper claims file, there is a Virtual VA electronic claims file associated with the Veteran's claim.  A review of the documents in the electronic file reveals that they are either duplicative of the evidence in the paper claims file or are irrelevant to the issue on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nCOPD was not present in service and is not etiologically related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nCOPD was not incurred in or aggravated by active duty.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2011), and the pertinent implementing regulation, codified at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2011), provide that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  They also require VA to notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the Secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the plain language of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) requires that notice to a claimant pursuant to the VCAA be provided \"at the time\" that, or \"immediately after,\" VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for VA-administered benefits.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 119 (2004).  The Court further held that VA failed to demonstrate that \"lack of such a pre-AOJ-decision notice was not prejudicial to the appellant, see 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 7261(b)(2) (as amended by the Veterans Benefits Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-330, \ufffd 401, 116 Stat. 2820, 2832) (providing that '[i]n making the determinations under [section 7261(a)], the Court shall...take due account of the rule of prejudicial error').\"\r\n\r\nThe timing requirement enunciated in Pelegrini applies equally to the initial-disability-rating and effective-date elements of a service-connection claim.  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that the Veteran was provided all required notice in letters mailed in August 2005 and October 2008.  Although the Veteran was not provided complete notice until after the initial adjudication of the claim, the Board finds that there is no prejudice to him in proceeding with the issuance of a final decision.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993).  In this regard, the Board notes that following the provision of the required notice and the completion of all indicated development of the record, the originating agency readjudicated the Veteran's claim.  There is no indication in the record or reason to believe that the ultimate decision of the originating agency on the merits of the claim would have been different had complete VCAA notice been provided at an earlier time.  See Overton v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 427, 437 (2006) (A timing error may be cured by a new VCAA notification followed by a readjudication of the claim).  \r\n\r\nThe record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain or to assist in obtaining all relevant records pertinent to the matter on appeal.  Service treatment records and all available pertinent post-service medical records have been obtained.  In addition, the Veteran has been afforded appropriate VA examinations and adequate VA medical opinions have been obtained.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has identified any outstanding evidence that could be obtained to substantiate the claim.  The Board is also unaware of any such evidence.  Therefore, the Board is satisfied that VA has complied with its duty to assist the Veteran in the development of the facts pertinent to this claim.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board will address the merits of the claim.\r\n\r\nLegal Criteria\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability due to disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303. \r\n\r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as opposed to merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word \"chronic.\"  When the fact of chronicity in service (or during any applicable presumptive period) is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b). \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d). \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2011).  When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a fair preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).\r\n\r\nFactual Background and Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that his current COPD is a result of a motor vehicle accident while in service in February 1959.  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that the evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000). \r\n\r\nService treatment records document that the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident in February 1959 when his jeep went off the road and rolled over.  A February 1959 admission note reports that the Veteran sustained contusions on the left rib cage, right shoulder and the abdomen.  He complained of moderate to severe pain in his left anterior chest with breathing.  The Veteran was discharged in April 1959 with a diagnosis of rupture, traumatic liver; abrasions, left chest; contusion, chest, left and abdomen; hemothorax, traumatic right, secondary to surgery.  He had undergone an exploratory laparotomy and thoracotomy.\r\n\r\nA November 1959 hospital note indicates that the Veteran had fallen and hit the right anterior chest and abdomen and developed a golf ball-sized mass.  The diagnosis was an abscess without lymphangitis, right abdominal wall, at the site of previous drainage.\r\n\r\nA July 1962 chest X-ray study disclosed that the right costophrenic angle appeared blunted.  This was thought to probably be the result of previous inflammatory reaction within the right lower chest with secondary adhesions.  There was no evidence of active lung disease.\r\n\r\nJune 1965 and October 1967 chest X-ray studies were normal.  \r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Veteran's service treatment records are negative for evidence of any pulmonary disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2005.  The examination was conducted without review of the Veteran's claims file.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had a collapsed lung in service as a result of a motor vehicle accident.  The Veteran reported that his breathing was worse than it used to be.  He had smoked cigarettes for 30 out of the last 40 years and had at least 1 pack per day and at times 2 packs per day.  Chest X-rays demonstrated no congestive failure, pleural effusion or active infiltrates.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran had moderate obstructive lung disease due to smoking.  This was not a result of his motor vehicle accident while he was in the military.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2010 which was conducted by a VA physician's assistant.  The physician's assistant noted that during service the Veteran was diagnosed with traumatic right hemothorax secondary to his liver laceration surgery.  Pleuritic changes were noted on the right chest.  June 1965 and October 1967 chest X-rays were normal.  A July 1969 chest X-ray study noted blunting of the costophrenic angle secondary to adhesions.  A current chest X-ray study demonstrated extensive fibrotic changes bilaterally.  There was no significant interval change in appearance of the chest compared with the September 2005 study.  The VA physician's assistant opined that the Veteran's COPD was not etiologically related to the Veteran's active service.  COPD is a result of complex interplay between clinical and molecular (i.e. genetic) risk factors.  Most epidemiologic studies indicate that cigarette smoking is overwhelmingly the most important risk factor for COPD.  The physician's assistant noted that the previous VA examiner in September 2005 specifically stated that the Veteran's COPD was not caused by the hemothorax in service but rather by his many years (30+) of smoking.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2011.  The examiner, a VA physician, noted that the Veteran sustained significant injuries in a motor vehicle accident while on active duty.  These injuries included a liver laceration and a hemothorax on the right side.  In the intervening years, there was little on the record of his having significant respiratory symptoms that required treatment.  Many years later, he was diagnosed with COPD.  Chest X-ray findings and pulmonary function test results support the diagnosis of COPD.  There is also some evidence of residuals of an old injury that date back to the 1960s on chest X-rays.  However, these findings do not apparently have anything to do with COPD.  These possibly could be related to other lung and respiratory disabilities but the Veteran has not been diagnosed with these.  COPD is a common illness which far and away is most likely caused by cigarette smoking in this country.  The Veteran quit smoking in about 2005 but had smoked at least one pack per day and frequently 2 packs per day for 40 years.  It was much more likely that smoking is the cause of the COPD.  The residuals from his injuries in the service are much less likely to be the cause of his COPD.\r\n\r\nConsidering the pertinent evidence of record in light of the applicable legal criteria, the Board finds that service connection for COPD is not warranted.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records show that he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in February 1959 which resulted in a collapsed lung.  However, the service treatment records do not show that he was found to have any pulmonary disorder and chest X-rays were normal  \r\n\r\nThere is no post-service medical evidence suggesting the presence of any pulmonary disorder until many years following the Veteran's discharge from service.  The first medical evidence of his claimed COPD disability is more than 28 years after service.  Such a long interval of time between service separation and the earliest documentation of the disease is, of itself, a factor weighing against a finding of service connection.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000).\r\n\r\nSignificantly, the record also includes no medical opinion suggesting that the Veteran's COPD is attributable to his active service, and neither the Veteran nor his representative has presented, identified, or alluded to the existence of any such opinion.  To the contrary, the medical opinions in the claims file specifically state that the most likely cause of the Veteran's COPD was his long history of cigarette smoking.  The Board notes that notwithstanding any other provision of law, a veteran's disability shall not be considered to have resulted from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active service on the basis that it resulted from injury or disease attributable to the use of tobacco products by the veteran during the veteran's service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1103.  \r\n\r\nAs discussed above, VA physicians and a VA physician's assistant have examined the Veteran, reviewed the Veteran's pertinent history, and opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's COPD disability was related to his service to include the Veteran's February 1959 motor vehicle accident.  In addition, the examiners ultimately provided adequate rationale for their opinions.  \r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran might sincerely believe that his COPD disability was caused by his service to include his February 1959 motor vehicle accident which resulted in a collapsed lung, his lay opinion concerning this matter requiring medical expertise is of no probative value.  See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 (1992).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the benefit of the doubt rule, but has determined that it is not applicable to this claim because the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for COPD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nShane A.

In April 2004, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD).  A statement of the case (SOC) was issued in January 2006, and the Veteran filed a substantive appeal (via a VA Form 9, Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals) in March 2006. \r\n\r\nPursuant to her request, the Veteran was scheduled for a Board hearing at the RO in March 2010.  However, she failed to appear for the hearing, has not provided any cause for her failure to attend the hearing, and has not requested rescheduling of the hearing.  Her hearing request has thus been deemed withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.702(d) (2012).  \r\n\r\nIn April 2010, the Board, without explanation, recharacterized the appeal as a claim for service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD.  The Board then remanded the claim to the RO, via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), for additional development and consideration.  In June 2011, the AMC issued a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) reflecting denial of the claim and returned the claims file to the Board for further appellate review. \r\n\r\nIn January 2012, the Board stated that the issue had been reframed as a claim for service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD) in accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet.App. 1 (2009), in which the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA must consider claims for service connection for psychiatric disabilities more broadly in appropriate cases.  At that time, the Board again remanded the claim to the RO, via the AMC, for further development and consideration and, in October 2012, the AMC issued a SSOC continuing to deny the claim; thereafter, the appeal was returned to the Board for further appellate review.  However, upon current, further review of the claims file, the Board now finds that this is not an appropriate case for application of Clemons.  \r\n\r\nIn Clemons, the Court construed a Veteran's pro se claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD as encompassing claims for any acquired psychiatric disorder because he had submitted only one (1) claim and was seeking service connection for psychiatric symptoms that had been variously, but not distinctly, diagnosed.  23 Vet.App. at 2-5, 8.  Here, unlike in Clemons, the appellant was represented prior to the initial decision on her claim and she submitted multiple distinct claims for service connection: her September 2003 claims form explicitly states that she was seeking service connection for \"1) PTSD; 2) Depression/anxiety\" and \"4) Insomnia.\"  As observed by the Court in Clemons, \"the claimant's intent in filing a claim is paramount to construing its breadth.\"  Id. at 5 (citing Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 232, 256).  \r\n\r\nIn May 2004, the Veteran made her intent more apparent by writing to VA and observing that the issues of depression, anxiety, and insomnia had not been addressed in the March 2004 rating action.  She pleaded with the RO to \"please understand that these issues are separate disabilities with a different diagnosis and should not be considered a symptom\" - she indicated that she had purposefully claimed distinct disabilities that had been separately diagnosed and were being separately treated.  The Veteran specifically requested that VA \"make a determination on my depression, anxiety, and insomnia.\"  Since the Veteran's claims and intentions are clear, and the issues of entitlement to service connection for depression, anxiety, and insomnia have not yet been adjudicated, the Board is limiting the claim on appeal as one for service connection for PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe issues of entitlement to service connection for depression/anxiety and insomnia have been raised by the record, but have not been adjudicated by RO.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over them, and they are referred to the RO for appropriate action.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All notification and development actions needed to fairly adjudicate the claim for service connection for PTSD have been accomplished. \r\n\r\n2.  Although the record reflects assessments of PTSD, the weight of the competent, persuasive evidence establishes that the Veteran does not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD are not met. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107(b) (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2012).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, and 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012)) includes enhanced duties to notify and assist claimants for VA benefits.  VA regulations implementing the VCAA were codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and 3.326(a) (2010). \r\n\r\nNotice requirements under the VCAA essentially require VA to notify a claimant of any evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim, as well as the evidence that VA will attempt to obtain and which evidence he or she is responsible for providing.  See, e.g., Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet.App. 183 (2002) (addressing the duties imposed by 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)).  As delineated in Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet.App. 112 (2004), after a substantially complete application for benefits is received, proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; (3) that the claimant is expected to provide; and (4) must ask the claimant to provide any evidence in her or his possession that pertains to the claim, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1). \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, effective May 30, 2008, 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 has been revised, in part.  See 73 Fed.Reg. 23,353 -23,356 (April 30, 2008).  Notably, the final rule removes the third sentence of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) (1), which had stated that VA will request that a claimant provide any pertinent evidence in his or her possession. \r\n\r\nVA's notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service connection claim: veteran status, existence of a disability, a connection between the veteran's service and the disability, degree of disability, and effective date of the disability. Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet.App. 473 (2006). \r\n\r\nVCAA-compliant notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA benefits by the agency of original jurisdiction (in this case, the RO, to include the AMC).  Id.; Pelegrini, 18 Vet.App. at 112. See also Disabled American Veterans v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed.Cir. 2003).  However, the VCAA notice requirements may, nonetheless, be satisfied if any errors in the timing or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the claimant.  Id.   \r\n\r\nIn this appeal, an October 2003 pre-rating letter provided notice to the Veteran as to what information and evidence was needed to substantiate a claim for service connection (to include, more specifically, a claim for service connection for PTSD), what information and evidence must be submitted by the appellant, and what information and evidence would be obtained by VA.  The Board observes that the letter did not provide her with general information pertaining to VA's assignment of disability ratings and effective dates, and no subsequent letter has so informed her.  However, as the claim for service connection for PTSD is herein being denied, no disability rating or effective date is being assigned so the Veteran is not prejudiced by the lack of notice in accordance with Dingess/Hartman.  \r\n\r\nIn April 2012, the AMC mailed the Veteran a letter advising her, pursuant to Dixon v. Derwinski, 3 Vet.App. 261, 263-264 (1992), that alternative forms of evidence could be developed to substantiate the claim, including, but not limited to, \"buddy certificates\" and letters.  Since providing this additional notice, the AMC has readjudicated the claims in an October 2012 supplemental SOC so the timing defect in the provision of this additional notice, since it did not precede the initial adjudication of the claims, has been rectified (\"cured\").  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 499 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed.Cir. 2007); (Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet.App. 370, 376 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain or to assist in obtaining all relevant records pertinent to the matter herein decided.  Pertinent evidence associated with the claims file consists of service treatment records, VA and private treatment records, and the report of a June 2010 VA examination.  Also of record and considered in connection with the appeal are various written statements provided by the Veteran and by her representative, on her behalf.  The Board notes that, in addition to the paper claims file, there is a paperless, electronic (Virtual VA) claims file associated with the Veteran's claim.  A review of the paperless claims processing system does not reveal any additional documents pertinent to the present appeal.  The Board also finds that no additional RO action to further develop the record in connection with the claim for PTSD, prior to appellate consideration, is required.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has reported receiving private treatment for depression and anxiety and VA has attempted to obtain the records for which she submitted authorization forms, but she indicated in an October 2003 statement that her PTSD was diagnosed and treated by VA.  Further, although the AMC's April 2012 letter again requested that she submit medical evidence from hospitals, clinics, and private providers by which or by whom she was treated after separation from service, the Veteran's authorized representative submitted an October 2012 Expedited Processing and Waiver form stating that they did not have any additional evidence regarding the appeal.  Neither the Veteran nor her representative has identified any additional existing evidence that is necessary for a fair adjudication of the specific claim on appeal.  Under the circumstances, the Board finds that the RO has undertaken sufficient and appropriate action to obtain those records and that no further action in this regard is warranted.  \r\n\r\nThe Board further notes that this claim was remanded in April 2010 and January 2012 for the RO to assist the Veteran with development to attempt to verify some of her alleged stressors for her PTSD claim and for her to undergo a VA psychiatric examination.  All requested development was accomplished on remand, so there was compliance with these remand directives.  See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet.App. 97, 105 (2008); Dyment v. West, 13 Vet.App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (holding that there was no violation under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet.App. 268, 271 (1998) when the examiner made the ultimate determination required by the Board's remand). \r\n\r\nAs mentioned, on remand, the Veteran was afforded a VA psychiatric examination and medical opinion in June 2010.  The Board finds that such VA examination and accompanying opinion is adequate to decide the issues, as it is predicated on an interview with the Veteran, a review of the record, and a physical examination with diagnostic testing.  The opinion proffered considered all of the pertinent evidence of record, and provided a complete rationale, relying on and citing to the records reviewed.  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining a VA examination has been met.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4) .\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges concerns expressed by the Veteran and her representative concerning development of PTSD stressors.  However, as will be discussed in greater detail below, the claim for service connection for PTSD is being denied because the weight of the competent, persuasive medical evidence establishes that the Veteran does not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  As the claim is being denied on the basis of diagnosis (and not the occurrence of a stressor), any discussion of the efforts taken to establish the occurrence of the Veteran's claimed stressors is unnecessary.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir. 2000) (holding that the entire record must be reviewed, but each piece of evidence does not have to be discussed).  As is evident, below, the analysis in this decision focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence, and on what the evidence shows or fails to show with respect to the appealed claim.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet.App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the duties imposed by the VCAA have been considered and satisfied.  Through various notices of the RO/AMC, the Veteran has been notified and made aware of the evidence needed to substantiate this claim, the avenues through which she might obtain such evidence, and the allocation of responsibilities between herself and VA in obtaining such evidence.  There is no additional notice that should be provided, nor is there any indication that there is additional existing evidence to obtain or development required to create any additional evidence to be considered in connection with this claim.  Consequently, any error in the sequence of events or content of the notice is not shown to prejudice the Veteran or to have any effect on the appeal.  Any such error is deemed harmless and does not preclude appellate consideration of the matter on appeal, at this juncture.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 537, 543 (2006) (rejecting the argument that the Board lacks authority to consider harmless error).  See also ATD Corp. v. Lydall, Inc., 159 F.3d 534, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\nII. Analysis\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) . \r\n\r\nOn July 13, 2010, VA published a final rule that amended its adjudication regulations governing service connection for PTSD by liberalizing, in certain circumstances, the evidentiary standard for establishing the occurrence of the required in-service stressor.  See 75 Fed.Reg. 39843 (July 13, 2010) and 75 Fed.Reg. 41092 (July 15, 2010) (correcting the effective and applicability dates from July 12, 2010 to July 13, 2010).  The revisions apply to, among others, claims appealed before July 13, 2010, but not yet decided by the Board. \r\n\r\nIn this case, however, the Veteran has not met the first essential criterion for service connection for PTSD-medical diagnosis of the disorder in accordance with the applicable diagnostic criteria.  As such, further discussion of the recent revisions to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304  is unnecessary. \r\n\r\nDiagnoses of PTSD must be rendered in accordance with the diagnostic criteria for the condition set forth in the Fourth Edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.125 (noting that VA has adopted the nomenclature of the DSM-IV). \r\n\r\nConsidering the pertinent evidence in light of the above, the Board finds that the weight of the competent, persuasive medical evidence establishes that the Veteran does not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and that, therefore, the claim must be denied. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records are negative for any finding or diagnosis of PTSD.  Psychiatric evaluation was normal at the time of her separation from service and she indicated on a contemporaneous (May 1993) self report of medical history that she did not experience, and had never experienced, \"nervous trouble of any sort\" or \"depression or excessive worry.\"\r\n\r\nIn May 1997, the Veteran wrote to VA and reported that she and her husband had experienced \"mental and emotional problems since 1993.\"  She reported private treatment from a Dr. Barrera.  Records from Dr. Barrera reflect treatment for multiple injuries and notes dated July and August 1996 attribute injuries to domestic abuse.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was seen for a Persian Gulf Registry examination in December 1996.  The psychiatric portion of the examination report reflects that the Veteran reported insomnia due to working different shift hours at work, but denied being depressed or nervous.  She expressly denied flashbacks and nightmares.  The Veteran reported some counseling, but stated it was for marital problems.  She was seen for a follow-up appointment regarding non-psychiatric symptoms in January 1997.  The treatment note describes her as nervous, but cooperative.  As the Veteran had complained of headaches memory loss during the Registry examination, she was scheduled for additional testing.\r\n\r\nShe was examined for headaches and numbness in June 1997.  She informed the VA physician that she had undergone marital counseling and had experienced \"a good deal of domestic violence\" after returning from active duty service and felt depressed.  However, the Veteran reported that her domestic situation was much improved, that she and her husband were no longer in counseling, and that she did not have any current depression.  The physician diagnosed her with an adjustment reaction and advised psychological evaluation. \r\n\r\nIn September 1997, the Veteran underwent VA neuropsychological testing.  The psychologist noted that the Veteran evidenced some family discord and distress.  Although noting that the results of multiple psychological batteries were consistent with a chronic pain protocol with anxiety and depression, the psychologist diagnosed her with 'chronic adjustment,' and stated that no follow-up was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe RO issued an August 1998 rating decision denying service connection for an adjustment disorder.  The Veteran did not appeal the denial.\r\n\r\nPrivate treatment notes from Dr. Barrerra reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in October 1998.  A December 1998 states that she requested medication for anxiety - Dr. Barrerra diagnosed dysthymia.  August 2001 and November 2002 treatment notes reflect renewal of her prescription medication for anxiety.  In March 2003, Dr. Barrerra noted that the Veteran was experiencing depression as well as anxiety.  A July 2003 treatment note reflects that her depression had not improved and that she was experiencing suicidal ideation without plan.  She was advised to seek outside care and other private treatment notes reflect that she sought emergency treatment that same month.  The hospital emergency room treatment record shows that she was seen for depression with suicidal ideation.  She informed the treating emergency physician that her private doctor was treating her and the physician advised that she follow up with a psychiatrist.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran wrote to VA in September 2003, claiming entitlement to service connection for PTSD as well as \"depression/anxiety.\"  The Veteran wrote that \"my doctor diagnose me as having PTSD, something I knew nothing about.\"  Although she did not identify the diagnosing doctor, she wrote that she had been treated for the claimed \"conditions\" by Dr. Barrerra and by a physician at the San Antonio VA Medical Center.  On an October 2003 authorization for the release of medical records, the Veteran wrote that she was receiving PTSD treatment from VA.  That same month, she wrote again to VA and contended that she had experienced depression and anxiety and insomnia \"ever since [she] came back from the Gulf War.\"  In November 2003, Dr. Barrerra again noted her depression and indicated that she was being treated at VA.\r\n\r\nVA treatment notes reflect that the Veteran was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD by a VA physician/family practitioner, in August 2003.  She was treated with prescription medication and was afforded follow-up PTSD and depression screenings on a regular basis.  In a May 2004 statement, the Veteran clarified that her claimed PTSD, anxiety, and depression were \"different disabilities with a different diagnosis.\"  She stated that anxiety and depression should not be considered symptoms.  In an April 2004 statement, she indicated that she attributed both PTSD and depression to an in-service miscarriage.\r\n\r\nThe report of a July 2005 VA annual check-up note include notation that the Veteran was stable and did not require acute intervention.  In August 2005, a depression screening was normal.  The Veteran reported \"PTSD symptoms persisting\" in March 2006 and was advised to continue her prescription medications.  However, a March 2006 VA PTSD screening yielded a negative result.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA joints examination in August 2006 for unrelated claims.  The examiner noted in the examination report that the Veteran displayed a flattened affect during the examination.  In September 2007, she was seen by a different VA physician-although PTSD was again reflected in the \"problem list\" portion of the treatment note, the physician did not assess current PTSD, but noted anxiety.  \r\n\r\nIn June 2010, the Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorders examination.  The examination report reflects that the examiner reviewed the claims file and all of the Veteran's treatment records.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report that she thought she began psychiatric treatment within one (1) year of discharge from active duty.  She also reported having received past psychiatric care from Dr. Barrerra, but stated she currently only took trazodone from VA.  Psychiatric evaluation was performed as was an in-depth interview with the Veteran.  The interview results reflect that she stated her PTSD resulted from an in-service miscarriage.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with depression and opined that she did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The examination report reflects the examiner's opinion that the medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran had experienced depression for \"many years.\"  Although stating that the Veteran's statements, in regard to the duration of her depression, were credible, the examiner concluded that she did not have PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe above-cited evidence reflects that the record contains conflicting medical opinions on the question of whether the Veteran has, at any time during the appellate period, actually met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. \r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the Board to assess the credibility and weight to be given the evidence.  See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet .App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992)).  The probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board.  See Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993). \r\n\r\nWhen reviewing such medical opinions, the Board may appropriately favor the opinion of one competent medical authority over another.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).  However, the Board may not reject medical opinions based on its own medical judgment.  Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30 (1993); see also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).  In assessing medical opinions, the failure of the physician to provide a basis for his opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-49 (2000).  However, a medical opinion may not be discounted solely because the examiner did not review the claims file.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board finds that the June 2010 VA examiners' medical opinion-that the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for a PTSD diagnosis-is the most probative medical opinion on this point.  This examiner conducted an interview with the Veteran and reviewed her treatment history and claims file, noted the pertinent history, described the Veteran's symptoms, and provided a reasoned analysis pursuant to the specific diagnostic criteria set forth in DSM-IV.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet.App. 379, 382 (1998); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 36, 40 (1994) (the probative value of a physician's opinion depends in part on the reasoning employed by the physician and whether or not (or the extent to which) he reviewed prior clinical records and other evidence).  Further, the examiner was a VA PTSD examiner, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the Board may assume VA medical examiners are competent.  See Rizzo v. Shinseki, 580 F.3d 1288, 1292 (Fed.Cir. 2009) (applying the presumption of regularity to VA medical examiners in the discharge of their official duties).  The Board finds the 2010 VA examiner's opinion on the matter of diagnosis highly probative. \r\n\r\nThe only medical evidence of record reflecting a diagnosis of PTSD are outpatient treatment records from the VA Medical Center in San Antonio.  These records indicate that a VA family practitioner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD in 2003 and that the diagnosis subsequently was copied into the \"problem list\" portion of later treatment notes.  Although, pursuant to Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet.App. 128, 140 (1997), VA may presume that a diagnosis made by a mental health care professional was made in accordance with the DSM-IV, there is no evidence that the family practitioner had any specialized training or experience in mental disorders.  In contrast, the June 2010 opinion was rendered by a VA PTSD examiner who, by VA policy, must have been a trained specialist.  VA Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1MR, Part III, subpart iv, 3.A.1.d.  An examiner's experience and expertise add weight to his opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 302-04.\r\n\r\nThe VA examiner's review of the Veteran's claims file and treatment record also add probative weight to his opinion.  Although the Court held in Nieves-Rodriguez, supra, that review of the claims file is not the determinative factor in assigning probative value, it observed the importance of a physician's knowledge of all relevant case facts.  The VA examiner demonstrated such knowledge by reviewing the Veteran's private treatment history and VA treatment history in order to determine that she had experienced depression in the past, but not PTSD. The examiner's conclusion was based on a thorough review and understanding of the Veteran's longitudinal history which makes it more probative than the diagnosis rendered by the VA family practitioner.  In short, the most persuasive opinion evidence weighs against the existence of a current diagnosis of PTSD, and ultimately, the claim.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the medical evidence of record, the Board has considered the assertions of the Veteran and those advanced by her representative, on her behalf.  However, to whatever extent these assertions are being offered to establish that the Veteran, in fact, has PTSD, such assertions provide no persuasive support for a finding in this regard.  These statements do not constitute probative medical evidence.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(1).  Although claimants are competent to describe their symptoms, a layperson is generally not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge.  See Bostain v. West , 11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992); Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 186 (1997).  PTSD is a complex psychiatric disability that cannot be diagnosed without special knowledge, training, and experience.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet.App. 428, 433, 438 (2011); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir. 2009).  As the Veteran and her representative are not shown to have the knowledge, training and expertise to diagnose PTSD, their lay assertions on the question of medical diagnosis of PTSD have no probative value.\r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the competent, probative evidence establishes that the first, essential criterion for service connection for PTSD-medical diagnosis of the disorder in accordance with the DSM-IV-is not met, service connection for PTSD cannot be established, and the Board need not address the remaining criteria for service connection for PTSD.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 49, 53-56 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJACQUELINE E.

Kung, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to December 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida, which, in pertinent part, denied a claim to reopen service connection for a post-operative left knee strain because new and material evidence had not been submitted. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at a December 2010 travel Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge; the hearing transcript has been associated with the claims file. \r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the case to the RO for further development in February 2011.  In April 2012, the Board granted the appeal to reopen service connection for post-operative left knee strain, remanded the claim for service connection for additional development.  The case is once again before the Board for review.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The Veteran reported treatment for left knee strain in service. \r\n\r\n2.  Left knee symptoms were not chronic in service and continuous since service separation.\r\n\r\n3.  Arthritis of the left knee did not manifest in service or within one year of service separation.\r\n\r\n4.  The Veteran's currently diagnosed left knee disability is not related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for a left knee disability, claimed as post-operative left knee strain, are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2012). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations imposes obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2011); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.326(a) (2012).  The notice requirements of VCAA require VA to notify the claimant of what information or evidence is necessary to substantiate the claim; what subset of the necessary information or evidence, if any, the claimant is to provide; and what subset of the necessary information or evidence, if any, the VA will attempt to obtain.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) issued a decision in the appeal of Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), which held that the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service-connection claim, including the degree of disability and the effective date of an award.  Those five elements include: (1) veteran status; \r\n(2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between a veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn a November 2007 letter, the RO provided preadjudicatory notice to the Veteran regarding what information and evidence is needed to substantiate a claim for service connection on the merits, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the Veteran, and what evidence VA would obtain.  The November 2007 VCAA notice letter included provisions for disability ratings and for the effective date of the claim.\r\n\r\nThe Board is satisfied VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records and evidence.  Specifically, the information and evidence that has been associated with the claims file includes service treatment records, private treatment records, VA examinations, and the Veteran's statements and testimony.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has indicated that treatment records, showing treatment for his left knee in November 1969, are missing from his record.  The RO/AMC has made several attempts to obtain such records.  Between February 2011 and November 2011, the RO made an additional requests for outstanding service records from the Camp Barrett, Quantico Marine Corps Base and the Naval Medical Center at Quantico; however, no such records were found.  For these reasons, the Board finds that all available service treatment records have been obtained, and that the additional records identified by the Veteran do not exist and that further efforts to obtain these records would be futile.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-95, 60 Fed. Reg. 43186 (1995).\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Board's April 2012 remand, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to address the claim for service connection for a left knee disability.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4) (2012).  When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The Board finds that the May 2012 VA examination and opinion obtained is adequate as it was predicated on an examination and interview of the Veteran, a review of the claims file to include relevant findings from service treatment records and post-service treatment records, considered the Veteran's lay statements with regard to the history, and the VA examiner provided and adequate rational for the opinion rendered based on an accurate factual history consistent with the Board's own findings.  For these reasons, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining a VA examination and opinion has been met.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nIn light of the foregoing, the Board finds that VA has provided the Veteran with every opportunity to submit evidence and arguments in support of his claim, and to respond to VA notices.  The Veteran and his representative have not identified any outstanding evidence that needs to be obtained.  For these reasons, the Board finds that VA has fulfilled the duties to notify and assist the Veteran. \r\n\r\nService Connection Laws and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  With chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service-connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of continuity of symptoms after service is required for service connection.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nWhere a veteran who served for ninety days or more during a period of war (or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946 develops certain chronic diseases, such arthritis, to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from separation from service, such diseases may be presumed to have been incurred in service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309.\r\n\r\nIn rendering a decision on appeal the Board must also analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40   (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (\"although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify\").\r\n\r\nThe Board is charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001); Wood v. Derwinski, \r\n1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).  In weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  The Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence in determining credibility, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).\r\n\r\nGenerally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion issued by a VA or private treatment provider takes into account such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the veteran's claims file.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).  Also significant is whether the examining medical provider had a sufficiently clear and well-reasoned rationale, as well as a basis in objective supporting clinical data.  \r\nSee Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999); Hernandez-Toyens v. West, \r\n11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998); see also Claiborne v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 181, 186   (2005) (rejecting medical opinions that did not indicate whether the physicians actually examined the veteran, did not provide the extent of any examination, and did not provide any supporting clinical data).  The Court has held that a bare conclusion, even one reached by a health care professional, is not probative without a factual predicate in the record.  Miller v. West, 11 Vet. App. 345, 348 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nService Connection Analysis \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing all the lay and medical evidence, including the Veteran's statements and testimony, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence does not establish that a currently diagnosed left knee disability is related to service.\r\n\r\nPrivate treatment records show that the Veteran has currently diagnosed tricompartmental arthritis in the left knee, chronic ACL tear, possible PCL tear, previous menisectomies to the medial and lateral aspects.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that his currently diagnosed left knee disability is related to a left knee strain in service.  In conjunction with his present claim, the Veteran has described, in detail, three injuries to the knee in service.  Two of the reported injuries were treated by a corpsman in the field with an ace bandage.  The Veteran reported that a third knee injury, which occurred in November 1969, required treatment at the Quantico Naval Hospital.  The Veteran reported that fluid was drained from his knee, and he was treated with physical therapy.  The Veteran reported when he was reexamined, a doctor told him that he had torn cartridge in his left knee which would require surgery.  The Veteran reported that he declined surgery and instead opted to be discharged one year early at the convenience of the government.  \r\n\r\nService treatment records do not reflect any treatment, diagnoses, or complaints referable to the left knee at any time in service.  A November 1969 separation examination, completed toward the end of that month, similarly does not describe any treatment, diagnoses, complaints or injury to the left knee despite the Veteran's contention that he injured his knee that month.  Clinical treatment records show that pursuant to the November 1969 separation examination, the Veteran was found physically qualified for all the duties at his rate at sea, in the field, and/or on foreign service.  A December 1969 post dispensary note shows that the medical record was closed that day by reason of release to inactive duty.\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence of record, lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence does not demonstrate chronic symptoms related to a left knee injury in, or continuous symptoms since service.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran indicated that there were outstanding service treatment records from November 1969 to December 1969, showing treatment for his left knee, which were missing from his record.  The Board notes, however, that the RO has made requests for outstanding service records from the Camp Barrett, Quantico Marine Corps Base and the Naval Medical Center at Quantico and no additional records were found.  Instead, service treatment records appear complete and include clinical treatment records from Quantico dated in November 1969 to December 1969, and service treatment records include a November 1969 separation examination report which made no mention of a left knee disability or injury.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran reported that he made an appointment to be seen at VA for his knee two weeks after his discharge in January1970, at which point his initial claim for service-connection was initiated.  According to a January 1970 claim, submitted approximately two weeks after the Veteran's separation from service, the Veteran identified treatment for left knee strain which occurred in November 1969.  \r\n\r\nThe record also shows that the Veteran has sustained several post-service injuries to the left knee.  The Veteran testified that he was injured in an automobile accident the day after he was married, in December 1970, approximately one year after his separation from service, but reported that he did not injure his knee at that time.  He indicated that he had surgery to the knee subsequent to that and that his knee has been symptomatic since that time.  However, VA examinations and a private treatment report dated in October 1974 show that the Veteran injured his left knee during the post-service automobile accident.  The Veteran had an anterior horn tear of the lateral meniscus and had been treated by removal of the lateral meniscus in October 1971.  The October 1974 private treatment report also noted a later twisting injury to the left knee at work.  VA treatment records dated in February 2007 show that the Veteran injured his left knee several months prior in a fall. \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the Veteran's report as to sustaining of some type of left knee injury in November 1969 is likely credible because it supported by a January 1970 claim submitted within one month of his separation from service.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements made as to the severity of such an injury is not credible, and the Board finds that the Veteran did not have chronic knee symptoms in service or subsequent to service due to such injury.  In that regard, a November 1969 separation examination was silent as to the presence of any chronic disability to the left knee and clinical treatment records similarly do not reflect a chronic left knee symptoms at the time of the Veteran's separation.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is no objective evidence to confirm the presence of torn cartilage the time of a November 1969 knee injury, and the Board finds that the Veteran is not credible in reporting having such an in-service diagnosis.  In that regard, while the Veteran has more recently reported in conjunction with his current claim for compensation that he had a left knee sprain diagnosed in November 1969, and that he was told that he had torn cartridge in his left knee which would require surgery; more contemporaneous evidence provided by a September 1974 examination shows that the Veteran reported that he sprained his knee in 1967, and not in 1969, and that he was treated in the field by a medic at that time.  Instead, he reported that his leg gave out on him during a little \"horse play\" in 1969, and that he had his knee was drained at that time.  The Veteran did not indicate that he was diagnosed with torn cartilage pursuant to the 1969 injury during the September 1974 VA examination.  Instead, the Veteran identified an operation and incision for torn cartilage after a 1970 automobile accident, and this was confirmed by evidence from an October 1974 private treatment report which shows that the Veteran had an anterior horn tear of the lateral meniscus and had been treated by removal of the lateral meniscus in October 1971.  \r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran has more recently reported that he did not injure his knee in a post-service motor vehicle accident, the more contemporaneous medical evidence of record dated in 1974 shows that the Veteran did injure his knee during the post-service motor vehicle accident.  In more recent statements made during a May 2012 VA examination, the Veteran described a left knee strain in 1969, which occurred while he was walking down some stairs.  However, in a detailed written statement dated in January 2008, the Veteran reported that he injured his knee in October 1969 while stationed in Quantico, Virginia, when he was ordered to play football.  He reported that his knee popped while playing football and that he had to have his knee drained.  The Board finds that the many inconsistencies in the Veteran's more recent lay statements with earlier statements, with statements made in conjunction with post-service treatment and evaluations for the knee, and with objective findings of record as described above, weigh against his credibility.  The Board has, therefore, accorded more probative weight to the objective evidence of record in this case.  \r\n\r\nThe objective medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran sustained a post-service injury to his left knee in a December 1970 automobile accident.  While the Veteran denied such an injury to his left knee during his December 2010 Board hearing; the Board finds this assertion is not credible where the Veteran's testimony conflicts with findings from VA and private treatment records dated in 1974.  The Board finds, therefore, that the Veteran has credibly reported some type of left knee injury in 1969; however, due to the inconsistencies in the Veteran's statements, the nature of that injury is not clear and the weight of the evidence shows that symptoms related to the injury were not chronic in service or continuous since service separation.  Instead, the evidence shows that the Veteran had a chronic post-service injury to the left knee in December 1970, which required surgery to the left knee in August 1971.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2012.  The May 2012 VA examiner reviewed the claims file.  During examination, the Veteran described his in-service left knee strain in 1969 and reported having chronic symptoms left knee pain thereafter.  The Veteran reported that he reinjured his knee in 1971 after his knee buckled, and that after this, he required surgery.  The Veteran reported that he was in a car accident at that time, but reported that he did not injure his knee during this accident.  However, in accordance with the Board's findings above, the Veteran is not credible in this statement as the more contemporaneous medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran did injure his left knee during this post-service motor vehicle accident.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner ultimately opined, based on a review of the claims file and consideration of the Veteran's lay statements, to include his report of an in-service left knee injury in 1969, that the Veteran's currently diagnosed left knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by a claimed in-service injury or event.  The VA medical opinion was based on a review and discussion of all of the relevant evidence of record.  The VA examiner reasoned that the Veteran had severe end-stage degenerative joint disease of the left knee, but accurately noted that there was no evidence of a knee injury in service consistent with that sequeale.  The VA examiner reasoned that the Veteran's separation examination was silent for knee complaint and the Veteran had a post service history of knee injury which required surgery.  The VA examiner further reasoned that even in the absence of this post-service injury, he would not find in favor of service connection for the reasons first mentioned, that there was no evidence of a knee injury in service consistent with the current diagnosis of severe end-stage degenerative joint disease.  The Board finds that the VA opinion is probative.  \r\n\r\nVA examiner considered the objective findings from service treatment records, as well as the Veteran's reported history of a 1969 left knee injury, but nonetheless opined that the Veteran's current left knee disability was not incurred in service.  Because the Veteran has not been credible in describing his history of injury to the left knee, both in service and subsequent to service, the Board finds that VA opinion was adequately based on objective findings as shown by the record, and the Board finds that the medical opinion rendered was based upon an accurate factual premise consistent with the Board's own findings in this case.  See Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 233 (1993); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).  Therefore, the Board finds that the May 2012 VA opinion provides competent, credible, and probative evidence which shows that the Veteran's currently diagnosed left knee disability is not etiologically related to service or to a reported in-service knee injury.  \r\n\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the weight of competent, credible, and probative evidence of record shows that a left knee injury was not incurred in service.  In making this determination, the Board has considered the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) regarding benefit of the doubt, but there is not such a state of equipoise of positive and negative evidence to otherwise grant the Veteran's claim.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for a left knee disability is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK.

M. Donahue, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from November 1961 to September 1965.  Portions of his 201 file are associated with his claims folder and reflect that he is authorized to wear the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the Vietnam Area of Operations while attached to and serving with Attack Squadron 23 onboard the USS MIDWAY (CVA 41) during the periods of April 10, 1965 to May 10, 1965, from May 21, 1965 to June 28, 1965, and from July 22, 1965 to August 24, 1965.  He had reported for duty to commence a continuous tour of sea duty on the USS MIDWAY on March 21, 1964 so it remains unclear the nature of other sea duty other than the dates cited for the award.  His DD 214 reflects a period of 1 year and 5 days of overseas duty and that he served as an AT-6610 (electronics technician).\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) is from actions taken by the above Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran provided testimony before the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge on Travel Board at the VARO in July 2008; a transcript is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  However, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that when a Veteran, who is a lay person, is not competent to diagnose his specific psychiatric disability. Therefore, VA must consider whether the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms regardless of the label attached to them warrant service connection.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  Accordingly, the Board has recharacterized the issue as above.\r\n\r\nA VA Form 21-6789 is of record dated in October 2005 reflecting that the Veteran's appellate claim now pending is the original not an attempt to reopen an earlier claim, correcting the correspondence to him that he needed new and material evidence to reopen.\r\n\r\nIn December 2008, July 2009, and November 2011, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim.  The VA Appeals Management Center (AMC) continued the previous denial of the claims in May 2009, March 2011, and July 2012 supplemental statements of the case (SSOCs).  Accordingly, the Veteran's VA claims folder has been returned to the Board for further appellate proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder was not manifested during active service nor was it developed as a result of an established event, injury, or disease during active service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, anxiety, and depression, was not incurred in or aggravated by military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2012); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2012).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nThe Board has given consideration to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA). The VCAA includes an enhanced duty on the part of VA to notify a claimant as to the information and evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for VA benefits. The VCAA also defines the obligations of VA with respect to its statutory duty to assist a claimant in the development of his claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA alters the legal landscape in three distinct ways: standard of review, notice, and duty to assist.  The Board will now address these concepts within the context of the circumstances presented in this case.\r\n\r\n      Notice\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), codified in pertinent part at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2010), and the pertinent implementing regulation, codified at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2012), provide that VA will assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim but is not required to provide assistance to a claimant if there is no reasonable possibility that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  They also require VA to notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the Secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  As part of the notice, VA is to specifically inform the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of which portion, if any, of the evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which part, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the plain language of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) requires that notice to a claimant pursuant to the VCAA be provided 'at the time' that, or 'immediately after,' VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for VA-administered benefits.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 119 (2004).\r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, the record reflects that the originating agency provided the Veteran with the required notice by a letter mailed in March 2005, prior to the initial adjudication of his claim.  In short, the record indicates the Veteran received appropriate notice pursuant to the VCAA.\r\n\r\nThe Board is cognizant of the fact that that the Veteran was not provided notice with respect to the effective date element of his claim.  In Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), the Court observed that a claim of entitlement to service connection consists of five elements: (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date.  Because a service connection claim is comprised of five elements, the Court further held that the notice requirements of section 5103(a) apply generally to all five elements of that claim.  Therefore, upon receipt of an application for a service connection claim, section 5103(a) and section 3.159(b) require VA to review the information and the evidence presented with the claim and to provide the claimant with notice of what information and evidence not previously provided, if any, will assist in substantiating or is necessary to substantiate the elements of the claim as reasonably contemplated by the application.  This includes notice that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Veteran's service connection claim, element (1), veteran status, is not at issue.  Moreover, elements (4) and (5), degree of disability and effective date, are rendered moot via the RO's denial of service connection for the Veteran's claimed disability.  In other words, any lack of advisement as to those two elements is meaningless, because a disability rating and effective date were not assigned.  The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for neurological residuals of injuries to the arms was denied based on elements (2), existence of a disability, and (3), connection between the Veteran's service and the claimed disability.  As explained above, he has received proper VCAA notice as to his obligations, and those of VA, with respect to these crucial elements.  Because as discussed below the Board is denying the Veteran's neurological disability claim, elements (4) and (5) remain moot.\r\n\r\n      Duty to Assist\r\n\r\nIn general, the VCAA provides that VA shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for VA benefits, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  The law affords that the assistance provided by VA shall include providing a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2012).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the Board finds reasonable efforts have been made to assist the Veteran in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate his claim.  There is no reasonable possibility that further assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  The pertinent evidence of record includes the Veteran's statements, service treatment records, as well as VA and private treatment records.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2009 and a VA opinion was obtained in November 2011.  The examination report and addendum reflects that the examiner interviewed and examined the Veteran, reviewed his claims folder, reviewed his past medical history, documented his current medical conditions, and rendered appropriate diagnoses consistent with the remainder of the evidence of record.  The Board therefore concludes that the VA examination report is adequate for evaluation purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.2 (2012); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) [holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate].\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that under the circumstances of this case, VA has satisfied the notification and duty to assist provisions of the law and that no further action pursuant to the VCAA need be undertaken on the Veteran's behalf.\r\n\r\nThe Board additionally observes that all appropriate due process concerns have been satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103 (2012).  The Veteran has been accorded the opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of his claim.  He has retained the services of a representative.  He was afforded a hearing before the undersigned in July 2008.\r\n\r\n      Stegall\r\n\r\nAs noted above, in November 2011, the Board remanded this case for further development.  Specifically, these remands instructed the AMC to obtain an additional VA opinion as to whether the Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disorder related to active duty.  As will be discussed in greater detail below, the RO obtained the requested opinion in November 2011.  As such, the Board finds that the purpose of the prior remands has been fulfilled, and there has been substantial compliance with its prior remand orders.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998) (duty to ensure compliance with Board remand order).\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\n      Legal Criteria\r\n\r\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.  When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002).  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) (2012).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d) (2012).\r\n\r\nTo establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: '(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service'-the so-called 'nexus' requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD specifically requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the disability, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) (2012).\r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f)(1) (2012); see also, 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b) (West 2002).  Otherwise, the law requires verification of a claimed stressor.\r\n\r\nWhere a determination is made that the Veteran did not 'engage in combat with the enemy,' or the claimed stressor is unrelated to combat, the Veteran's lay testimony alone will not be enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996); Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  In such cases, the record must include service records or other credible evidence that supports and does not contradict the Veteran's testimony.  Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 289 (1994).  Moreover, a medical opinion diagnosing PTSD does not suffice to verify the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors.  See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395-396; Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 42 (1997). \r\n\r\nIn recent years, the regulations governing PTSD have been amended, effective July 13, 2010. 75 Fed. Reg. 39843-52 (July 13, 2010).  Specifically, this amendment eliminates the requirement for corroborating that the claimed in-service stressor occurred if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Factual Background\r\n\r\nService treatment records, include October 1961 and September 1965 examination reports, are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\nIn an August 2002 VA mental health note, the Veteran complained of depressed feelings occasionally.  \r\n\r\nIn a January 2004 statement, the Veteran reported an in-service stressor including guns firing on the USS MIDWAY without warning which knocked him to the wall and floor, stunning him for several minutes.  \r\n\r\nDuring a September 2004 VA mental health consultation, the Veteran reported heavy combat exposure during the times his ship was close to shore.  He indicated that his occupation was record entry and loading bombs onto planes.  He reported several incidents related to getting sealed into a compartment, having a friend go overboard, and being close to shore under heavy fire.  He also reported being injured in a misfire, with resulting loss of consciousness for four hours.  After a mental health evaluation, the diagnosis was PTSD.  The provider noted that the Veteran reported some depressive symptoms, but did not appear to meet criteria for major depressive disorder at that time.  \r\n\r\nIn a January 2006 statement, the Veteran reported that in 1965 his ship fired on several shore targets, but all hands were not notified that firing would commence, and they were not given the opportunity to clear the deck.  He indicated that they were notified after the first shot, after they were stunned.  He noted that they were on full alert but not attacked.  He also reported that his friend fell off the ship while tying down planes, and that the ship circled several times, but that his body was not recovered.  \r\n\r\nDuring a July 2008 Travel Board hearing, the Veteran reported that his first stressor as when he was locked in a water-tight section of the ship with several other seamen.  He testified that he did not receive any treatment during service, and that he was not currently receiving treatment.  He reported memory problems, and relationship problems resulting in two failed marriages.  The Veteran also reported stressors including when a friend of his fell off the fantail of the ship.  \r\n\r\nDuring a February 2009 VA examination, the Veteran reported his stressor as the incident when his friend fell overboard from the carrier.  He reported that he and another sailor \"leaned on\" each other after the incident.  He denied any post-military traumatic events.  He stated that he worked with the US Postal Service for one year after service, did \"odd jobs\" from 1966 to 1971, and was with the fire department from 1971 for 20 years.  After a mental status evaluation, the diagnoses were anxiety and depression.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that he did not witness the death of his friend and reported no feelings of intense fear, hopelessness, or horror in response to this event.  He concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD.  He also pointed out that the Veteran gave no evidence that his reported anxiety and depressive symptoms cause any impairment of his social, occupational, or academic functioning.   \r\n\r\nA June 2009 VA progress note included a diagnosis of PTSD. \r\n\r\nIn a July 2009 VA mental health progress note, the Veteran reported having ongoing flashbacks and vivid memories as related to his military service (back/neck injuries, death of a friend, and combat zone gun fire).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2011.  The examiner conducted an interview of the Veteran, reviewed the claims file, and conducted a complete psychological examination.  After considering the foregoing, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with anxiety and depression, not otherwise specified (NOS).  She thereafter stated that '[t]he etiology of [the Veteran's] symptoms of anxiety and depression cannot be made without resorting to mere speculation...'  Thereafter, the examiner noted the Veteran does not have PTSD, and his claimed stressors are not related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  The examiner noted that the three stressors he claimed exposure to during the time he served aboard the USS MIDWAY did not meet Criteria C and F for a diagnosis of PTSD.  Additionally, his symptoms complaints of anxiety and depression do not meet the DSM-IV criteria for any mood disorder or anxiety disorder.  The Veteran reported no evidence of clinically significant distress or impairments (social, occupational or functioning in any other important area) due to his symptoms of anxiety or depression.\r\n\r\nVA Medical Opinion from Dallas VA Medical Center (VAMC) dated November 23, 2011 indicates diagnoses of anxiety disorder NOS, less likely than not caused by or a result of military service; and depressive disorder NOS, less likely than not caused by or a result of military service.  The provider noted that symptom complaints of anxiety and depression given by the Veteran did meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for the two disorders listed.  However, he indicated that the disorders were less likely than not caused by or a result of military service.  He noted that there was no evidence that service led to significant impairment in social/occupational/recreational activities.  He pointed out that the Veteran was successfully employed by the fire department for twenty years between 1971-1991.  He also noted that the Veteran reported good relationships with his children and siblings, and that he was the primary caretaker for his elderly mother.  He indicated that the Veteran owned his own photography business for a time and still practiced photography as an avocation.  He concluded that it was most likely that the Veteran's current depressive and anxiety symptoms were related to his complaints of memory problems, starting toward the end of a twenty year fire department career and continuing since that time; having to care for his elderly and ill mother; financial stress; and divorce in recent years.\r\n\r\n      PTSD\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the claims file contains no evidence that the Veteran received any awards or decorations indicative of combat, and there is nothing in his service records suggesting that he ever served in combat.  Therefore, the Veteran's claimed stressors cannot be presumed to have occurred under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b).\r\n\r\nWith regard to verifying the Veteran's reported stressors, the Board notes that, though the Veteran has consistently reported that he was on ship when his friend, E.B., a fellow seaman, died after falling overboard.  The RO attempted to verify the Veteran's stressor and determined that this stressor was not credible.  A search of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall information indicated that E. B. was a non-hostile sea casualty offshore from South Vietnam.  He drowned in November 1965, two months after the Veteran separated from active service.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the claims file contains VA treatment records noting the Veteran as having a diagnosis of PTSD related to witnessing the death of his friend in service.  Although the medical evidence includes diagnoses of PTSD related to his experience, there is no credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred.  In this regard, as noted by the AOJ, this claimed stressor occurred following the Veteran's separation from service.  Moreover, the Veteran himself has reported to a VA provider that he did not witness the event.  As such, the Board concludes that the diagnosis of PTSD based on this reported stressor cannot serve as the basis for a grant of service connection.\r\n\r\nThe Board also considered the Veteran's claimed stressors of being locked in a compartment and a head injury after a misfire; however, there is no indication in the deck logs or in the Veteran's service treatment records which verify this stressor.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board has considered the impact of the July 13, 2010, amendment on the Veteran's claim.  Only during the September 2004 VA evaluation did the Veteran claim a stressor to include hostile fire.  The Board notes that during the VA examinations dated in February 2009 and January 2011, the Veteran reported his main stressors as the death of his friend, being locked in a sealed room, and being stunned by a close-firing gun.  The January 2011 VA examiner specifically stated that the Veteran did not have PTSD, and, using the specific language of the statute, also found that his claimed stressors were not related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  The Board therefore finds that the evidence weighs against a diagnosis of PTSD based on a presumed combat stressor.  As the Veteran's stressors are not combat-related and not related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, the Board finds that the requirement for corroborating the claimed in-service stressor has not been eliminated, as the claimed stressors are not consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service.\r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that there is a conflict regarding whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD.  Two VA examiners have determined that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for such a diagnosis.  In assigning high probative value to the February 2009 and January 2011 opinions, the Board notes that the examiners had the claims file for review, specifically discussed evidence contained in the claims file, obtained a history from the Veteran, and conducted a complete examination.  There is no indication that the VA examiners were not fully aware of the Veteran's past medical history or that they misstated any relevant fact.  Rather, they provided a full discussion of the Veteran's documented history and of his own reported history before ultimately concluding that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board thus finds the VA examiners' opinions to be of greater probative value than the Veteran's statements, or the unsupported diagnosis provided by the September 2004 VA treating psychologist.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000) (noting that factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion include the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.); Neives-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  \r\n\r\nThe Board recognizes that the Court has held that the presence of a chronic disability at any time during the claim process can justify a grant of service connection, even where the most recent diagnosis is negative.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  However, the Board concludes that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of a PTSD diagnosis conforming to the DSM-IV at any time during the course of the appeal.  Therefore, the holding in McClain is inapplicable. \r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Board must conclude that the Veteran has not met the regulatory requirements of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, and that, on this basis, his claim must be denied.  \r\n\r\n      \r\nPsychiatric Disorder other than PTSD\r\n\r\nFor all other diagnoses, excluding PTSD, the Board finds service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is also not warranted. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran does have a current diagnosis of depression and anxiety.   However, the earliest medical evidence of depression dates from August 2002, more than 35 years after discharge from service.  The passage of many years between discharge from active service and the medical documentation of a claim disability is evidence against a claim of service connection.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Shaw v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 365 (1992).  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that there is no competent medical opinion supporting his contention of depression due to active duty.  Furthermore, the November 2011 VA examiner provided an opinion at the request of the Board has indicated that the Veteran's depression was less likely than not related to his active duty.  The examiner found depression and anxiety are related to his complaints of memory problems; having to care for his elderly and ill mother; financial stress; and divorce in recent years.  The findings of a physician are medical conclusions that the Board cannot ignore or disregard.  Willis v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 66 (1991).  \r\n\r\nIn sum, the Board has carefully considered the statements regarding the Veteran's psychiatric disability.  While the Board does not doubt the sincerity of his belief that his acquired psychiatric disorder was a result of his active service, these claims turn on a medical matter.  Though the Veteran may be competent to testify as to the sensory perceptions of his current disorder, questions of medical diagnosis and causation are within the province of medical professionals.  See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-38 (1994).  Lay persons are limited to attesting to factual matters of which they have first-hand knowledge, e.g., experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005).  As a layperson without the appropriate medical training or expertise, the Veteran is not competent to render a probative opinion on such a medical matter.  See Bostain v. West, 11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  See also Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 186 (1997) ('a layperson is generally not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge').  Here, while the Veteran is competent to say he has psychiatric symptoms, he is not competent to say that his current psychiatric diagnoses are a result of disease or injury in service.  Hence, the assertions in this regard do not constitute persuasive evidence in support of the claim for service connection.\r\n\r\nGiven the absence of credible evidence that the Veteran's has a chronic psychiatric disorder in service, the absence of any opinion that the Veteran's current disorders are related to service, and competent medical opinions that they are not likely related, the Board must find that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder on any theory of entitlement.  Consequently, the claim must be denied.  As the evidence in this case preponderates against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nJ.

Schulman, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, had service from January 1958 to May 1962.   \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2010 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Wichita, Kansas.\r\n \r\nA review of the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system does not reveal any additional documents pertinent to the present appeal.\r\n\r\nIn December 2010, VA received a print-out of an internet website called \"Hearing Loss\" from Mayoclinic.com.  The evidence was received prior to certification of the case to the Board, however in April 2013 VA received a waiver of RO original jurisdiction.  Hence the Board may properly consider the evidence in connection with the immediate appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran had exposure to noise in service.\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran did not experience chronic symptoms of hearing loss during service and did not have hearing loss at separation from service.\r\n\r\n3.  Hearing loss did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service and is not related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for establishing service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385 (2012).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2012).  Upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative, if any, of any information including medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim and of the relative duties of the VA and the claimant for procuring that evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b); \r\n\r\nThis notice must be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), as was done in this case.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  In this case, the RO provided a VCAA notice letter to the Veteran in November 2009, prior to the initial adjudication of the claim.  The letter notified the Veteran of what information and evidence must be submitted to substantiate a claim for service connection, as well as what information and evidence must be provided by the Veteran and what information and evidence would be obtained by VA.  The Veteran was also advised to inform VA of any additional information or evidence that VA should have, and to submit evidence in support of his claim to the RO.  The content of the letters complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b). \r\n\r\nIn addition, the notice requirements of the VCAA apply to all elements of a service-connection claim, including: (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  See, Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Further, this notice must include information that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded.  Id. at 486.  In this case the Veteran was provided with such notice, including the type of evidence necessary to establish a disability rating and effective dates in November 2009.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, timely and adequate notice was provided to the Veteran prior to the transfer and certification of his case to the Board and complied with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b).  \r\n\r\nNext, VA has a duty to assist the Veteran in the development of the claim.  To that end, VA must make reasonable efforts to assist the claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claim for the benefit sought, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2012); see Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1320 (2010).  However, \"[t]he duty to assist is not boundless in its scope\" and \"not all medical records . . . must be sought-only those that are relevant to the [V]eteran's claim.\" Golz at 1320, 21. \r\n\r\nHere service records have been obtained, as have records of private and VA treatment.  These pertinent records have been associated with the Veteran's claims file and reviewed in consideration of the issue before the Board.  The Veteran has indicated that he had no additional information or evidence to submit in support of his claim.\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2010, during which the examiner was provided the Veteran's claims file for review, took down the Veteran's history, considered private medical evidence, was a professional with the appropriate competency to comment on the Veteran's claimed disability, considered the lay evidence presented, laid a factual foundation for the conclusions reached, and reached conclusions based on the examination that are consistent with the record.  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has challenged the adequacy of the examination obtained.  Sickels v. Shinseki, 643 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that the Board is entitled to presume the competence of a VA examiner and the adequacy of their opinion).  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining VA examination or opinion has been met.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4) (2012).\r\n \r\nThe Board finds that all necessary development has been accomplished, and therefore appellate review may proceed without prejudice to the Veteran.  See, Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  In addition to the evidence discussed above, the Veteran's statements in support of the claim are also of record.  The Board has carefully considered such statements and concludes that no available outstanding evidence has been identified.  The Board has also reviewed the medical records for references to additional treatment reports not of record, but has found nothing to suggest that there is any outstanding evidence with respect to the Veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Board finds that the duties to notify and assist the Veteran in this claim have been met, so that no further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in the development of the claim.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000), aff'd 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001).\r\n\r\nService Connection for Bilateral Hearing Loss\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2012).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999), citing Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996). \r\n\r\nSensorineural hearing loss, which is an organic disease of the nervous system, is a \"chronic disease\" listed under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a); therefore the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Where the evidence shows a \"chronic disease\" in service or \"continuity of symptoms\" after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service.  In order to show a \"chronic\" disease in service, the record must reflect a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  Where a chronic disease has been incurred in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service-connected unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of \"continuity of symptoms\" after service is required in order to establish entitlement to service connection.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).    \r\n\r\nAdditionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases, such a organic diseases of the nervous system, become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  Id.\r\n\r\nGenerally, lay evidence is competent with regard to a disease with \"unique and readily identifiable features\" that is \"capable of lay observation.\"  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308-09 (2007) (concerning varicose veins); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a dislocated shoulder); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) (tinnitus); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995) (flatfoot); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above, however, a veteran is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions and, specifically, is not competent to provide an opinion as to etiology in such cases.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (concerning rheumatic fever).  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(2). \r\n\r\nLay evidence can be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Additionally, a lay person may speak to etiology in some limited circumstances in which nexus is obvious merely through observation, such as sustaining a fall leading to a broken leg.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77.\r\n\r\nHere, the Veteran is claiming entitlement to service connection for loss of hearing.  For the purposes of this claim, the threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).  For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385 (2012).\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, the Board observes that VA audiometric readings prior to June 30, 1966, and service department audiometric readings prior to October 31, 1967, must be converted from American Standards Association (ASA) units to International Standards Organization (ISO)-American National Standards Institute (ANSI). In the forgoing discussion, ASA units appear to the left and in parentheses, while ISO-ANSI units appear on the right.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that acoustic trauma during service caused his current hearing loss.  Specifically, in a January 2010 statement he indicated that the work he performed during service included conducting maintenance on jet aircraft while the engines were operating.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records reflect that on enlistment examination in December 1957, his ears and ear drums were normal, and whispered voice hearing recognition was 15/15 in both ears.  The Veteran affirmatively denied any history of ear trouble or running ears.\r\n\r\nBased on the Veteran's enlistment examination, the Board finds that the Veteran's hearing and ears were in sound condition at the time he entered service.  In June 1960, the Veteran underwent an audiological evaluation in which pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\n6000\r\nRIGHT\r\n(10) 25\r\n(5) 15\r\n(0) 10\r\n(10) 20\r\n(10) 15\r\n(15) 25\r\nLEFT\r\n(5) 20\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\n(15) 25\r\n(10) 15\r\n(15) 25\r\n\r\nThe evaluation report indicated that the Veteran \"seldom or never\" wore ear protection other than dry cotton during exposure to loud noise.  \r\n\r\nA December 1961 initial flight examination showed the ears and ear drums to be normal.  He had whispered voice recognition of 15/15 in both ears and pure tone thresholds as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\n6000\r\nRIGHT\r\n(0) 15\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\n(5) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\nLEFT\r\n(0) 15\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 5\r\n(0) 10\r\n\r\nThe Veteran again denied any history of ear trouble or running ears.\r\n\r\nOn separation examination in May 1962, the Veteran's ears and ear drums were normal, and he denied any history or current ear trouble or running ears.  Audiological evaluation revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\nRIGHT\r\n(0) 15\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\nLEFT\r\n(0) 15\r\n(0) 10\r\n(0) 10\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's did not have a chronic hearing loss disability during service.  While audiometric testing in June 1960 showed pure tone thresholds at 500 and 600 hertz in the right ear and at 3000 and 6000 hertz in the left ear were 25 decibels, indicting some hearing impairment, audiometric testing in December 1961 and on separation examination in May 1962 showed essentially normal hearing.  See Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 157.\r\n\r\nThis does not in itself preclude a grant of service connection.  Again, service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  Nevertheless, after a full review of the record, the Board finds that the weight of the lay and medical evidence does not demonstrate that hearing loss had its onset in service, was manifest to a compensable degree within on year of separation from service, and is not related to service for the reasons discussed below.\r\n\r\nFollowing separation in May 1962, an August 2009 primary care outpatient treatment record indicates that in August 2009 the Veteran reported hearing loss.  He stated that hearing loss had been present since 2006 but that he believed hearing loss began while working on jet aircraft during his service.  A physical evaluation revealed the external ear canals to be patent and without tenderness with no injection or effusion of the tympanic membrane.  An assessment of hearing loss was given.  On audiological evaluation in September 2009 pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tHERTZ\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\nRIGHT\r\n20\r\n25\r\n50\r\n70\r\n80\r\nLEFT\r\n20\r\n15\r\n40\r\n70\r\n80\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2010 during which he informed the examiner that while conducting communications and navigations repair on jet aircraft during service, he was sometimes provided hearing protection to wear.  He denied any post-service occupational noise exposure, however he endorsed recreational hunting and target shooting and stated that he wore hearing protection while target shooting.  On audiological evaluation pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERTZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500\r\n1000\r\n2000\r\n3000\r\n4000\r\nRIGHT\r\n5\r\n5\r\n35\r\n70\r\n70\r\nLEFT\r\n5\r\n10\r\n30\r\n65\r\n70\r\n\r\nPuretone threshold average on the right side was 45, and on the left side was 43.7.  Speech audiometry using the Maryland CNC word list was 96 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear.  Tympanometry revealed normal middle ear function bilaterally, and otoscopy was unremarkable bilaterally.  The diagnosis was bilateral high frequency sensorineural hearing loss.  The examiner went on to recognize the Veteran's in-service noise exposure, however she concluded that in light of the Veteran's in-service audiograms, the Veteran's current hearing loss was not caused by or a result of military service.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran and his representative have repeatedly contended that the Veteran's in-service noise exposure, including to jet aircraft, caused his current hearing loss disability.  In considering the Veteran's statements to this effect, the Board notes that the Veteran's in-service Military Occupational Specialty, which included working on communication and navigation systems, has been recognized by VA as one in which exposure to hazardous noise was highly probable.  Thus the Board finds that the Veteran had in-service exposure to such noises.  However, exposure to loud noise is not dispositive.\r\n\r\nWhile hearing loss is capable of lay observation, Layno, 6 Vet. App. 465, the cause of hearing loss is a more complex medical determination and not capable of lay observation.  Jandreau 492 F.3d 1372.  Accordingly the Veteran's statements averring to the etiology of his hearing loss are not competent because making such a connection would require specialized medical knowledge regarding differing causes of hearing loss and the medical processes which cause trauma to result in hearing impairment.  The Veteran has not been shown to have such specialized knowledge and thus his statements linking service with hearing loss are of no probative value.\r\n\r\nOf great probative value are normal separation examination and the conclusions reached by the VA examiner in October 2010 who, following an examination applied specialized medical training to conclude that the Veteran's hearing loss disability was not caused by or a result of military service.\r\n\r\nThe Board also considers the credibility of the Veteran's otherwise competent statements.  Again, service treatment records do not reflect in-service complaints referable to hearing loss.  Although the Veteran had one in-service examination showing reduced hearing in June 1960, his hearing was normal at separation.  Furthermore, the Veteran's recent reports have been inconsistent regarding the date of his hearing loss onset.  Specifically, in August 2009 he reported to a medical professional that symptoms began in 2006, while he now avers that his hearing loss began in service.\r\n\r\nIn weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.  See generally Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  The Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence in determining credibility, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006); but see Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint after service can be considered along with other factors in the analysis of a service connection claim). \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the Veteran's claims of in-service onset are not credible.  Specifically, this finding is made based on inconsistencies in  the Veteran's statements regarding in-service and post-service onset, and objective audiometric data showing that hearing was normal at separation.  In contrast, when the Veteran thereafter presented his account on in-service hearing loss onset, he was seeking VA benefits rather than medical treatment.  The Board is not free to ignore assertions as to any matter upon which a veteran is competent to offer an opinion, see Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341, 345 (1999); and see Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (interest may affect the credibility of testimony), however for the foregoing reasons such assertions are found to be not credible.\r\n\r\nFar more probative is the Veteran's August 2009 statement to a health car provider that hearing loss had been present only since 2006.  Because the Veteran was then seeking only medical treatment, and not compensation, it seems likely that he would report events carefully and accurately. Statements made to a healthcare provider for purposes of diagnosis and treatment are exceptionally trustworthy because the declarant has a strong motive to tell the truth in order to receive proper care.  As the Veteran's statement of a 2006 on-set is both competent and credible, the Board finds that hearing loss did not manifest in-service, within one year of service or until many years after service.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran sent VA an article from a Mayo Clinic internet website entitled \"Hearing Loss.\"  The article states that the primary factors contributing to hearing loss are heredity and chronic exposure to loud noises.  Medical treatise evidence can, in some circumstances, constitute competent medical evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(1) (competent medical evidence may include statements contained in authoritative writings such as medical and scientific articles and research reports and analyses).  However, generic information from a medical journal or treatise is \"general and inconclusive\" to establish a medical nexus to a disease or injury.  Mattern v. West, 12 Vet. App. 222, 228 (1999) (citing Sacks v. West, 11 Vet. App. 314, 317 (1998)).  A medical article or treatise can provide support for a claim, but must be combined with an opinion of a medical professional and be reflective of the specific facts of a case as opposed to a discussion of generic relationships.  Sacks v. West, 316-17.\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the document submitted by the Veteran, including the fact that it indicates that sound from a jet engine can cause injury.  Nonetheless, in light of the lack of an interpreting opinion of a medical professional, the article is of no probative value in the Veteran's specific case. \r\n\r\nIn sum, the weight of the evidence establishes that bilateral hearing loss first developed decades after service and that it is unrelated to service.  Accordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, and there is no doubt to be resolved.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b), Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nK. J.

Chisholm, Attorney at Law\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nA.M.Clark, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran performed honorable active military service from November 6 to December 4, 1980.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Montgomery, Alabama.  Jurisdiction of the claims file has subsequently been transferred to the RO in Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before he undersigned Veterans Law Judge in July 2009.  A copy of the transcript is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the case for development in December 2009.  In May 2011, the Board denied the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran appealed the denial to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an Order, dated in August 2011, the Court granted a Joint Motion to Remand of the parties, the VA Secretary and the Veteran, and remanded the case to the Board for readjudication consistent with the motion.  The Board once again remanded the case in April 2012 to afford the Veteran a VA examination and opinion.  The Board finds substantial compliance with the April 2012 remand directives.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  A May 2013 supplemental statement of the case was issued, and the case is once again before the Board.\r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability has been raised by the record, but has not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over it, and it is referred to the AOJ for appropriate action.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that any diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder is related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1131, 1132, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.   Duties to Assist and Notify\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), VA has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2013).  \r\n\r\nProper notice from VA must inform the claimant and his representative, if any, prior to the initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the AOJ of any information and any medical or lay evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b); Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  These notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service-connection claim (veteran status, existence of a disability, a connection between the veteran's service and the disability, degree of disability, and effective date of the disability).  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  Information that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if service connection is awarded must be included.  Id.\r\n\r\nHere, neither the Veteran nor his representative has alleged prejudice with respect to notice, as is required.  See Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009); Goodwin v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 128 (2008); Hartman v. Nicholson, 483 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Dunlap v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 112 (2007).  None is found by the Board.  In March 2007 the Veteran was notified via letter of the criteria for establishing service connection, the evidence required in this regard, and his and VA's respective duties for obtaining evidence.  He was additionally notified of how VA determines disability ratings and effective dates if service connection is awarded.  Thus, no further development is required with respect to the duty to notify.\r\n\r\nThe Board also concludes VA's duty to assist has been satisfied.  The Veteran's service treatment records, VA treatments records and VA examination report were obtained.  Private treatment records identified by the Veteran have been obtained.  The Board has additionally reviewed the Veteran's Social Security Administration (SSA) records, his Virtual VA file, and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) file.  The Veteran has not identified any existing evidence that is necessary for a fair adjudication of the claim that has not been obtained. \r\n\r\nDiscussion of the Veteran's July 2009 Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) hearing is also necessary.  The individual presiding over a hearing must comply with the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103(c)(2).  Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010).  These duties consist of (1) fully explaining the issues and (2) suggesting the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked.  They were met here.  Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder was identified as an issue at the hearing.  Sources of evidence relevant in this regard were identified during this hearing.  Indeed, as noted above, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim in December 2009 to locate the Veteran's SSA records.  The Board finds that, consistent with Bryant, the VLJ complied with the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103(c)(2).\r\n\r\nNext, a specific VA examination and opinion was obtained in September 2012.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c) (4).  To that end, when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  The Board finds that the September 2012 VA examination and opinion obtained in this case is more than adequate, as it is predicated on a full reading of the Veteran's claims file.  The VA examiner considered all of the pertinent evidence of record, to include his service treatment records, personal statements and history, and provided detailed rationale for the opinion stated.  See Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion comes from when it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, and sound reasoning for the conclusion).  \r\n\r\nThe Board concludes that all the available records and medical evidence have been obtained in order to make an adequate determination as to this claim.  Hence, no further notice or assistance is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in the development of the claim.  Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000), aff'd, 281 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); see also Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  He attributes this disorder to a gas-mask training exercise in service.  \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1131(West 2002).  Generally, the evidence must show:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.   Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hansen v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 110 (2002); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).\r\n\r\nContinuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service or in the applicable presumptive period is not, in fact, shown to be chronic, or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) (2013).  The provisions of \ufffd 3.303(b) only apply to the list of chronic disabilities identified under \ufffd 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge from active duty when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d) (2013).  \r\n\r\nService treatment records reflect that an adjustment disorder was discovered almost immediately upon entering active service and resulted in the Veteran's administrative discharge only 29 days later.  A November 21, 1980 entry in his military health record reflects that the Veteran doubted his ability to adjust to military life.  His mood was mildly depressed with some agitation.  He had vague suicidal ideation.  The report states \"Seems to exhibit characteristics of an avoidant personality disorder.\"  The report recommends an administrative discharge.  The November 21, 1980, service treatment record does not offer a diagnosis of a personality disorder or mental disorder; it simply mentions a mildly depressed mood, agitation, suicidal ideation, and certain characteristics of a personality disorder. \r\n\r\nPost service treatment records show diagnoses of a major depressive disorder, depression, an anxiety disorder, and an adjustment disorder.  The Veteran asserts he has experienced psychiatric issues since service.  The Board is cognizant that the Veteran's service treatment records show complaints of psychiatric problems and he has alleged continuous symptoms since service.  However, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) only apply to chronic diseases as listed in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  An acquired psychiatric disorder is not a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R \ufffd 3.309(a).  Thus, consideration under 38 C.F.R \ufffd 3.303(b) is not warranted. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the evidence does not establish that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder is related to service.  The Veteran has been afforded a September 2012 VA examination and opinion.  The September 2012 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with depression.  The VA examiner considered the Veteran's reports of a gas mask training exercise where he was unable to properly put on his mask so he ran out of the shed where the training exercise was occurring and was made to go back in.  She indicated that she would be issuing an opinion based on her clinical experience and expertise, a review of the Veteran's file, the results of a structured interview and the Veteran's psychiatric test results.  She noted that the Veteran's Global Assessment of Function (GAF) score was indeterminate due to exaggeration of symptoms on testing.  She noted that while this did not dismiss the Veteran's possible depression symptoms, the severity simply could not be determined.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, regardless of the severity level of the Veteran's depressive symptoms, she noted that based on the available information there did not appear to be enough evidence to suggest that the Veteran's depressive symptoms began while he was in the military.  She noted that the Veteran had not sought treatment for several years after his time in the service and he did not report hearing voices until the mid 1990's nearly 15 years after he left service.  She also noted that there was no mental health diagnosis given to the Veteran while in the service, despite the recommendation for administrative separation on November 21, 1980.  She concluded indicating that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's depressive symptoms started while he was in the military.   \r\n\r\nIn support of his claim, the Veteran has submitted two private examinations and opinions which relate his acquired psychiatric disorder to service.  The Veteran initially underwent a private clinical evaluation with Dr. J. C. in December 2011 and January 2012.  After reviewing the Veteran's claims file, interviewing the Veteran and various family members the private examiner diagnosed the Veteran with major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, with psychotic features.  He additionally diagnosed an anxiety disorder and rule out posttraumatic stress disorder.  He opined that it was his professional opinion, with a reasonable degree of psychological certitude, that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's psychiatric conditions, namely, major depressive disorder, as well as an anxiety disorder, began during military service, with the origin of both being the gas mask training incident.  Rationale was not provided.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion comes from when it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, and sound reasoning for the conclusion).  As such, the probative value of this December 2011 and January 2012 medical opinion is limited. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted an additional addendum opinion from the same private examiner in January 2012.  He noted shortcomings of the VA examination.  He additionally noted that he stood by his earlier report of December 2011 and January 2012 in which he diagnosed the Veteran with a major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder and rule out posttraumatic stress disorder.  He indicated that both the Veteran's major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder began during his military service with the origin of both being the gas-mask training incident.  Once again rationale for this opinion was not provided. \r\n     \r\nIn this case, the Board finds that the statements provided by the private examiner are outweighed by the conclusions of the September 2012 VA examiner.  Significantly, the private examiner did not provide rationale for his conclusions, while the September 2012 VA examiner did provide rationale for her determinations.  The Board determines that the private examiner's conclusions are outweighed by the observations of the VA examiner.\r\n\r\nThe only other evidence which purports to link the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disorder to his military service consists of the statements of the Veteran and his friends and family.  Although laypersons, such as the Veteran and his friends and family, are sometimes competent to provide opinions on certain medical questions, the specific issue in this case falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person as it involves making definitive clinical diagnoses based on knowledge of psychiatric medicine.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer).  While the Veteran and his friends and family can describe what he experiences (in this case, depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood) or their observations, they are not able to provide competent evidence as to the etiology of his acquired psychiatric disorder or to attribute it to a particular diagnosis or any diagnosis at all.  Providing such an opinion requires medical expertise in the identification of psychiatric disorders and the causes of such.  The Veteran and his friends and family have no such expertise.  See Jandreau, supra; see also 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (a)(1) (2013).\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the September 2012 VA opinion is the most probative evidence of record.  This is because the VA examiner reviewed his records, considered his reported history, and examined the Veteran.  As explained above, the competent medical evidence of record does not demonstrate that there is a relationship between the Veteran's in-service psychiatric complaints and his current acquired psychiatric disorder.  Although the Board notes the Veteran's current complaints and in-service treatment, without sufficiently probative evidence of a medical nexus, service connection cannot be granted. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2013); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is denied. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nF.

Mishalanie, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to June 1975.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2007 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida, in which the RO denied service connection for a left shoulder disability.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2010, the Board remanded the claim to the RO, via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, DC, for additional development.  As will be further discussed below, the remand directives have been sufficiently complied with.  See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141 (1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  All notification and development actions needed to fairly adjudicate the matter on appeal has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n2.  While the Veteran was treated for a left shoulder contusion during service, the evidence does not show any ongoing follow-up treatment for a chronic left shoulder disability. \r\n\r\n3.  There is no competent evidence or opinion suggesting that a current left shoulder strain is related to his military service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for residuals of a left shoulder disability are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI. Duties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096 (Nov. 9, 2000) (codified at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, and 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2010) includes enhanced duties to notify and assist claimants for VA benefits. VA regulations implementing the VCAA were codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, and 3.326(a) (2010).\r\n\r\nNotice requirements under the VCAA essentially require VA to notify a claimant of any evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim(s), as well as the evidence that VA will attempt to obtain and which evidence he or she is responsible for providing.  See, e.g., Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002) (addressing the duties imposed by 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)).  As delineated in Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), after a substantially complete application for benefits is received, proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim(s); (2) that VA will seek to provide; (3) that the claimant is expected to provide; and (4) must ask the claimant to provide any evidence in her or his possession that pertains to the claim(s), in accordance with 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.159(b)(1).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that, effective May 30, 2008, 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 has been revised, in part.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 23,353- 23,356 (April 30, 2008).  Notably, the final rule removes the third sentence of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1), which had stated that VA will request that a claimant provide any pertinent evidence in his or her possession.\r\n\r\nVA's notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service connection claim: veteran status, existence of a disability, a connection between a veteran's service and the disability, degree of disability, and effective date of the disability.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  \r\n\r\nVCAA-compliant notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable decision on a claim for VA benefits by the agency of original jurisdiction (in this case, the RO).  Id.; Pelegrini, 18 Vet. App. at 112.  See also Disabled American Veterans v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  However, VCAA notice requirements may, nonetheless, be satisfied if any errors in the timing or content of such notice are not prejudicial to the claimant.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn this appeal, an August 2006 pre-rating letter provided notice to the Veteran regarding what information and evidence is needed to substantiate the claim for service connection, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the Veteran, and what information and evidence would be obtained by VA.  The letter also specifically informed the Veteran to submit any evidence in his possession pertinent to the claim on appeal (consistent with Pelegrini and the version of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 then in effect).  In addition, the August 2006 letter provided the Veteran with information pertaining to VA's assignment of disability ratings and effective dates, as well as the type of evidence that impacts those determinations, consistent with Dingess/Hartman.  Hence, this letter meets Pelegrini's and Dingess/Hartman's content of  notice requirements, as well as the VCAA's timing of notice requirement.\r\n\r\nThe record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain or to assist in obtaining all relevant records pertinent to the matter on appeal.  In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) were found to be unavailable for review.  A January 2007 Memorandum details the RO's attempt to obtain these records.  In an August 2006 letter, the Veteran was notified that his STRs were unavailable and he responded by provided copies of the STRs that were submitted with his original claim.  In addition, the claims file consists of the Veteran's VA outpatient treatment records dated from November 2006 to April 2008; reports of VA examinations conducted in February 2007 and February 2009; and a June 2008 VA supplemental medical opinion.  Also of record and considered in connection with the appeal are various written statements provided by the Veteran and by his representative, on his behalf.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that no further RO action on this matter, prior to appellate consideration, is warranted.  In this regard, in his March 2009 substantive appeal, the Veteran asserted that, in a February 2, 2008 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for a left shoulder disability and assigned a 10 percent rating effective June 9, 2006.  As noted by the Board in its July 2010 remand, there was some evidence in VA's electronic tracking system suggesting that some action was taken on February 2, 2008, however, there was no such rating decision of record.  The Board instructed the RO/AMC to send a letter to the Veteran requesting that he provide a copy of the February 2008 rating decision.  A letter was sent on July 2010 and the Veteran responded later that month, indicating that he did not have a copy of the rating decision and that he did not have any additional evidence to support his claim.  The Board also instructed the RO/AMC to obtain any temporary claims folder or separately maintained records which might exist, if any.  The AMC requested that the RO search for any temporary claims folders, but none were found.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the RO/AMC has substantially complied with the Board's July 2010 remand orders.  See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (remand not required under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998) where Board's remand instructions were substantially complied with).\r\n\r\nIn summary, the duties imposed by the VCAA have been considered and satisfied.  Through various notices of the RO/AMC, the Veteran has been notified and made aware of the evidence needed to substantiate this claim, the avenues through which he might obtain such evidence, and the allocation of responsibilities between himself and VA in obtaining such evidence.  There is no additional notice that should be provided, nor is there any indication that there is additional existing evidence to obtain or development required to create any additional evidence to be considered in connection with any of these claims.  Consequently, any error in the sequence of events or content of the notice is not shown to prejudice the Veteran or to have any effect on the appeal.  Any such error is deemed harmless and does not preclude appellate consideration of the matter on appeal, at this juncture.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 537, 543 (2006) (rejecting the argument that the Board lacks authority to consider harmless error).  See also ATD Corp. v. Lydall, Inc., 159 F.3d 534, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\r\n\r\nII.  Laws and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  \r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed.Cir.1996) (table); see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303. \r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden/Caluza element is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 494-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999).  Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; see Hickson, 12 Vet. App. at 253 (lay evidence of in-service incurrence sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nIn relevant part, 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 1154(a) requires that the VA give \"due consideration\" to \"all pertinent medical and lay evidence\" in evaluating a claim to disability or death benefits.  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.\"  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir. 2007).  In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis.  Id. at 1376-77; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F .3d 1331, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2006); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. Sept 14, 2009). \r\n\r\n\"Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology.\"  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 496 (citing Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991).  Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") and credibility (\"a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted\").\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  Presumptive periods are not intended to limit service connection to diseases so diagnosed when the evidence warrants direct service connection.  The presumptive provisions of the statute and VA regulations implementing them are intended as liberalizations applicable when the evidence would not warrant service connection without their aid.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that the evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claims and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).\r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).  \r\n\r\nIII.  Legal Analysis\r\n\r\nConsidering the evidence in light of the governing legal authority, the Board finds that the claim for service connection for residuals of a left shoulder injury must be denied.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran asserts that he has a current left shoulder disability related to an injury he sustained during service while playing basketball.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs reflect that the Veteran was treated in the emergency room the evening of October 12, 1972 for torn ligaments in the left shoulder.  An October 13 clinic note indicates that he was to continue on analgesics and was given a temporary profile.  On October 16, it was noted that he was still sore, that his sling was cut, and that he went to physical therapy.  A physical therapy note dated that same day indicates that he was started on hot packs to the left shoulder and pendulum and range of motion exercises.  An orthopedic clinic note dated that same day indicates that his shoulder was tender with soft tissue swelling over the distal clavicle to the suprascapular space and minimally of the acromioclavicular joint.  It was also noted that elevation resulted in increased pain.  An X-ray showed no fracture.  The impression was a contusion.  It was recommended that he continue with physical therapy and use a sling until comfortable.  There are no follow-up records of treatment for the left shoulder during service.  The report of a May 1975 discharge examination reflects that his upper extremities were normal.  \r\n\r\nPost-service, the Veteran's VA treatment records dated from November 2006 to April 2008 do not show any complaint, treatment or diagnosis relating to a left shoulder disability.\r\n\r\nThe report of a February 2007 VA joints examination reflects the Veteran's complaints of left shoulder pain and stiffness.  He said that he injured his left shoulder playing basketball in service in October 1972.  It was noted that post service the Veteran was employed doing flooring work that involved strenuous use of both the upper and lower extremities for several years.  The diagnoses were \"torn left shoulder ligament during active military duty in October 1972; resolved based on clinical objective evidence\" and \"residuals left shoulder strain most likely caused by a post service event based on clinical objective evidence.\"  The examiner, a VA physician, indicated that she could not \"resolve this issue without resorting to mere speculation.\"  The examiner noted that the rationale was that although the claims file documented torn left shoulder ligaments in October 1972, there was no objective evidence that the left shoulder injury was the cause of his current left shoulder strain, which was documented 35 years after the initial left shoulder injury.  Furthermore, the examiner noted that the Veteran had been employed for several years in manual labor with flooring; that there was no objective evidence that the Veteran sustained a chronic left shoulder condition during active service; and that there was no objective data to support continued evaluation and treatment for the in-service left shoulder injury following release from active duty.  The examiner noted her opinion was based on clinical examination, medical record review, medical literature review, and clinical experience. \r\n\r\nIn his June 2007 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran noted that he did not engage in hard manual labor installing floors, but that he just cut carpet so that it could be installed.  He said that cutting carpet was far less strenuous on his shoulder than installing carpet would be and that for the past 24 years, he had been employed in an office environment with the Department of Children and Families.  He said he did not make any complaints at the time of discharge because the condition was not so severe as to require medication or to warrant complaint of severe pain.  \r\n\r\nIn June 2008, the February 2007 VA examiner provided a supplemental medical opinion.  The examiner reviewed the Veteran's June 2007 NOD, noting that the Veteran said that said that his shoulder had hurt at the discharge examination, but that he did not report it.  The examiner opined that it would be \"with resort to mere speculation to opine if veteran's current residuals of his left shoulder injury is [sic] related to the documented torn left shoulder ligament in service, with the need for physical therapy.\"  The examiner noted that she took into account the Veteran's subjective June 2007 statement, but that there was still no objective data to support his claim.  \r\n\r\nThe report of a February 2009 VA examination reflects the Veteran's history as noted above.  The Veteran said that he spent a week in a sling and was on temporary profile for two weeks following the in-service injury.  He said that the condition progressively worsened.  On physical examination, there was objective evidence of pain with active range of motion.  The diagnosis was left shoulder strain.  The examiner, a different VA physician, opined \"As per previous opinion at C&P exam 2/07, I cannot resolve this issue without resorting to mere speculation.\"  The rationale given was that there was no evidence that the Veteran was seen for follow-up treatment of his left shoulder during service and that his separation physical examination was normal.  The examiner also noted that there were no records of left shoulder complaints or treatment within 1 year of service and that it had been 36 years since the service injury.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran's history of intercurrent injury was unknown.  Finally, the examiner stated that she \"did not find compelling evidence that veterans current left shoulder strain is due to injury in service\" and did not \"find compelling evidence to disagree with the opinion 2/07.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards to the Veteran's current diagnosis, the earliest objective medical evidence of a left shoulder strain is the February 2007 VA examination - almost 35 years after the Veteran's in-service injury.  The Board notes that the passage of so many years between discharge from active service and the objective documentation of a claimed disability is a factor that weighs against a claim for service connection.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran asserts that he has had chronic left shoulder problems since his injury in service.  The Board points out that the Veteran, as a layperson, is competent to report on matters observed or within his or her personal knowledge.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(2); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report a continuity of symptomatology.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). Here, however, the Board does not find the Veteran's statements to be credible.  Although the medical evidence clearly documents that the Veteran had a left shoulder injury in October 1972, his STRs do not show that he had follow-up or ongoing treatment for a chronic left shoulder disability.  Furthermore, on physical examination prior to discharge in May 1975, it was noted that his upper extremities were normal.  Hence, the medical evidence is contrary to the Veteran's later assertions, that he has had a chronic left shoulder disability since the in-service injury.  The Board points out that the contemporaneous medical records are more persuasive than the Veterans later assertions made in the course of filing a claim for benefits.  Furthermore, the record does not contain any complaint of left shoulder problems until the Veteran filed his claim in June 2006 and he was not diagnosed with a left shoulder sprain until his VA examination in February 2007.  Thus, continuity of symptomatology has not been established by either the clinical record or the Veteran's own statements.\r\n\r\nAs regards the etiology of the Veteran's left shoulder disability, the Board points out the only competent medical opinions of record indicate that it would require resorting to mere speculation to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's current left shoulder disability is at least as likely as not related to service.  The Court, in Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382 (2010), found that when a medical examiner states no conclusion as to etiology or diagnosis can be reached without resorting to speculation, it must be clear that the examiner has considered \"all procurable and assembled data,\" by obtaining all tests and records that might reasonably illuminate the medical analysis.  Id. at 390.  Furthermore, the Court stated that the phrase \"without resort to mere speculation\" should reflect the limitation of knowledge in the medical community at large and not of a particular examiner.  Id.\r\n\r\nIn this case, both the February 2007 and February 2009 VA examiners are VA physicians.  In fact, the February 2007 VA examiner is the current Medical Director of the C&P unit at the Gainesville VA Medical Center.  Hence, the Board finds no reason to find that either examiner has limited knowledge or a lack of expertise in this particular matter.  Furthermore, both examiners performed clinical evaluations of the Veteran, and considered the medical evidence of record - in particular, the Veteran's STRs - along with the Veteran's own self-reported history.  The February 2007 examiner even revisited the issue after the Veteran submitted a statement indicating that his prior work experience did not really involve heavy manual labor as was noted previously.  It is clear that both examiners considered all procurable and assembled data and the Veteran, himself, has indicated that he has no additional evidence to submit, or which needs to be obtained, relating to his left shoulder disability.  The Board also points out that although each examiner indicated it would be resorting to mere speculation to provide an opinion, they later stated that there was no compelling evidence that the Veteran's current left shoulder disability was due to the in-service injury.  The Board is aware that the applicable legal standard is not whether there is \"compelling\" evidence, but simply whether the evidence is evenly balanced with respect to whether or not a disorder was incurred in service.  Although neither examiner gave definitive opinions, these statements tend to weigh against the claim for service connection.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Board has considered the written statements of the Veteran and his representative, to the extent that any such lay statements are being offered to answer the question of whether the Veteran's current left shoulder disability is related to service, such evidence must fail.  Such matters are within the province of trained medical professionals.  Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-38 (1994).  As the Veteran and his representative are laypersons without the appropriate medical training or expertise, they are not competent to render probative (i.e., persuasive) opinions on these medical matters.  See Bostain v. West, 11 Vet. App. 124, 127 (1998), citing Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492 (1992).  See also Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 186 (1997) (\"a layperson is generally not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge\").  Consequently, the lay assertions as to the etiology of the Veteran's current left shoulder disability have no probative value.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection for residuals of a left shoulder injury must be denied.  In arriving at the decision to deny the claim, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, in the absence of competent and persuasive evidence to support the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for residuals of a left shoulder injury is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL MARTIN\r\nActing Veterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "60b606cdf8611168dd279cf8", "name": "1311391.txt", "plainText": "Citation Nr: 1311391\t\r\nDecision Date: 04/05/13    Archive Date: 04/19/13\r\n\r\nDOCKET NO.  04-07 479A\t)\tDATE\r\n\t)\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the\r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New Orleans, Louisiana\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  \r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nThe Veteran\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nChristopher Maynard, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from December 1973 to December 1974, and from March 1981 to April 1983.  \r\n\r\nThe Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) denied service connection for PTSD in April 1996, and October 2000.  \r\n\r\nThis matter initially came before the Board on appeal from a July 2003 decision by the RO which declined to reopen the claim of service connection for PTSD.  A videoconference hearing before the undersigned was held in August 2006.  In January 2007, the Board reopened the Veteran's claim and remanded the appeal for additional development.  The Board remanded the appeal for additional development again in July 2009 and August 2011.  \r\n\r\nAs discussed at length in the July 2009 remand, the issue currently on appeal is limited solely to the claim of service connection for PTSD.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran does not have PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe Veteran does not have PTSD due to disease or injury which was incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2012).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBefore addressing the merits of the Veteran's claim, the Board is required to ensure that the VA's \"duty to notify\" and \"duty to assist\" obligations have been satisfied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2012).\r\n\r\nUnder the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA), when VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, it must notify the claimant of the information and evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate a claim, which information and evidence VA will obtain, and which information and evidence the claimant is expected to provide.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159.  Such notice must indicate that a disability rating and an effective date for the award of benefits will be assigned if there is a favorable disposition of the claim.  Id; 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159, 3.326; see also Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004) (Pelegrini II).  \r\n\r\nA pre-adjudicatory RO letter dated June 2003 notified the Veteran of the types of evidence and/or information deemed necessary to substantiate her claim, the relative duties on the part of herself and VA in developing her claim, and the criteria for establishing a disability rating and effective date of award, should service connection be established.\r\n\r\nHowever, the June 2003 notice letter was defective to the extent that it did not notify the Veteran of the evidence and/or information deemed necessary to substantiate a personal assault claim.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f)(5) (VA will not a PTSD claim based on inservice personal assault without first advising of sources of behavior change evidence).  This notice defect was cured with a corrective VCAA notice in February 2007, and RO readjudications of the claim in subsequent supplement statements of the case.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370, 376 (2006).  As the Veteran has had adequate opportunity since 2007 to provide additional evidence, the Board finds that no prejudice has accrued to the Veteran at this time to further delay adjudicating this case.\r\n\r\nAs to VA's duty to assist, the Board finds that all necessary development has been accomplished and that appellate review may proceed without prejudice to the Veteran.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  The RO has undertaken all known efforts to obtain STRs for the Veteran's first period of active service from December 1973 to December 1974, including under her former husband's name and service hospitals and clinics where the Veteran reported treatment.  In March 2010, the RO made a formal finding of unavailability and notified the Veteran by letter dated April 2010.  The Board finds that any additional record searches would be futile.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the VA and private medical records identified by the appellant as relevant to the appeal have been obtained and associated with the claims file.  Additionally, the RO obtained records related to the Veteran's application for disability benefits with the Social Security Administration.  The Board also reviewed the Veteran's VA electronic medical records.  The Veteran was examined by a panel of three VA psychiatrists during the pendency of this appeal and testified before the undersigned at a hearing at the RO in May 2011.  The Board finds that the October 2011 VA panel examination was comprehensive and adequate upon which to base a decision on the merits of the issue on appeal.  The Veteran was interviewed and examined; the report included a detailed description of her medical history, a discussion and analysis of the clinical findings, and rational explanation for the conclusions reached.  \r\n\r\nAs discussed in the August 2011 remand order, the Board is of the opinion that an opinion with diagnosis based, in part, on face-to-face interview of the Veteran would provide a better opinion than an Independent Medical Examiner (IME) review of the claims folder alone.\r\n\r\nNotably, in July 2009, the Board ordered VA examination to be conducted \"by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.\"  (emphasis original).  The RO obtained an examination report prepared by VA psychologists who concluded that the Veteran met the DSM-IV criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, but reported that it could not be ascertained that 3 of the DSM-IV criteria could be linked to a conceded stressor (the Veteran witnessing the death of a civilian).  As discussed in an August 2011 remand, the opinion offered increased the confusion in this case - which is riddled with inconsistent statements by the Veteran and multiple disagreement among treating physicians as to the appropriate psychiatric diagnosis, or diagnoses.  Notably, the case had previously been reviewed by an IME for these reasons.\r\n\r\nThe Board is aware that the July 2010 VA examination report could be construed as being partially favorable to this claim, including the disputed issue as to whether the Veteran manifests PTSD.  The Board is also aware that it is not permissible to undertake additional development merely for the purpose of developing negative evidence.  See, e.g., Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).  In the Board's judgment, the contents of the July 2010 VA examination report were inadequate for rating purposes and had to be returned.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.2.  An addendum was not sought as the Board's prior remand directives ordered examination by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists rather than psychologists.  If an addendum opinion from the psychologists returned an adverse determination, than the Board would have been relying on opinion from a specialty not in accord with the August 2011 remand directives.  See generally Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998) (holding that a remand by the Board confers on the Veteran, as a matter of law, the right to compliance with the remand). \r\n\r\nFurther, neither the Veteran nor her representative have made the RO or the Board aware of any additional evidence that needs to be obtained in order to fairly decide the issue on appeal, and have not argued that any error or deficiency in the accomplishment of the duty to assist has prejudiced her in the adjudication of her appeal.  \r\n\r\nConcerning the May 2011 Travel Board hearing, in Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010), the Court held that 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103(c)(2) requires that the individual who chairs a hearing must fully explain the issues and to suggest the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked.  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the undersigned discussed the issue and the bases of the prior RO determination, and asked specific questions directed at identifying any pertinent evidence not currently associated with the claims folder that might have been overlooked or was outstanding and might substantiate the claim.  Accordingly, the Veteran is not shown to be prejudiced on this basis.  \r\n\r\nNeither the Veteran nor her representative have asserted that VA failed to comply with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103(c)(2), nor has she identified any prejudice in the conduct of the Board hearing.  By contrast, the hearing focused on the elements necessary to substantiate the claim, and the Veteran, through her testimony, demonstrated that she had actual knowledge of the elements necessary to substantiate her claim.  As such, the Board finds that, consistent with Bryant, the undersigned has complied with the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103(c)(2).\r\n\r\nFinally, the case has been subject to prior Board remands.  The RO has associated current treatment records with the claims folder, provided the Veteran a PTSD personal assault letter and, ultimately, obtained an adequate opinion produced by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.  As such, the Board finds that the RO has substantially complied with prior Board remand directives.  Stegall, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nBased on a review of the claims file, the Board finds that there is no indication in the record that any additional evidence relevant to the issue to be decided herein is available and not part of the claims file.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 499 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Accordingly, the Board finds that duty to notify and duty to assist have been satisfied and will proceed to the merits of the Veteran's appeal.  \r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a).  Service connection may be demonstrated either by showing direct service incurrence or aggravation or by using applicable presumptions, if available.  Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  \r\n\r\nDirect service connection requires a finding that there is a current disability that has a definite relationship with an injury or disease or some other manifestation of the disability during service.  Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992); Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 548 (1992).  In general, service connection requires a claimant to satisfy a three element test: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called 'nexus' requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances, certain chronic diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a) may be presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year from discharge from service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307 are also satisfied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(b).\r\n\r\nFor the showing of chronic disease in service, there are required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify a disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word chronic.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).  Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or when the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  Id.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  Id.\r\n\r\nHowever, the continuity and chronicity provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) only apply to the chronic diseases enumerated in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, ___ F.3d ___, No. 2011-7184, 2013 WL 628429 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 21, 2013), overruling Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-96 (1997) (applying 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) to a chronic disease not listed in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a) as \"a substitute way of showing in-service incurrence and medical nexus.\")\r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, the Veteran's claimed PTSD disability is not among the list of chronic diseases listed within 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a).  Thus, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303(b) and 3.309(a) do not apply in this case.\r\n\r\nIn McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the requirement that a claimant have a current disability before being granted service connection is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim, even though the disability may have resolved by the time VA adjudicates the claim. \r\n\r\nIn relevant part, 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 1154(a) requires that the VA give \"due consideration\" to \"all pertinent medical and lay evidence\" in evaluating a claim to disability or death benefits.  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2007).  In fact, competent medical evidence may not be necessary in all types of cases depending upon the subject matter at hand.  Id. at 1376-77; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F .3d 1331, 1337 (Fed.Cir.2006); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. Sept 14, 2009).  \r\n\r\nDisorders diagnosed after discharge may still be service connected if all the evidence, including pertinent service records, establishes that the disorder was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition, (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed, in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether the veteran engaged in \"combat with the enemy\" as established by official records, including recognized military combat citations, or other supportive evidence.  If the VA determines that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the alleged stressor is combat-related, then the veteran's lay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence of the stressor's occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence is required, provided that such testimony is found to be \"satisfactory,\" i.e., credible, and \"consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of service.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f); Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 164 (1996); West v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).  \r\n\r\nIf, however, the VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy or that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, but the alleged stressor is not combat-related, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is insufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain credible supporting evidence that corroborates the veteran's statements or testimony.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 142 (1993).  \r\n\r\nThe regulations pertaining to PTSD were recently amended, and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f)(3) no longer requires the verification of an in-service stressor if involving \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  Rather, lay testimony alone can be used to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor in these situations.  The Veteran alleges personal assault by a U.S. military member, and witnessing the accidental death of a civilian.  As here claimed stressor does not involve \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity,\" these new amendments do not apply to the case. \r\n\r\nFor claims involving service connection for PTSD due to personal assault, VA regulations provide, in pertinent part, as follows:  \r\n\r\n(3) If a post-traumatic stress disorder claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  VA will not deny a post-traumatic stress disorder claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence.  VA may submit any evidence that it receives to an appropriate medical or mental health professional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a personal assault occurred.  \r\n\r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) (2012).  \r\n\r\nIn Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999), the Court held that special consideration must be given to claims for PTSD based on personal assault.  In particular, the Court held that the provisions in M21-1, Part III, 5.14(c), which address PTSD claims based on personal assault are substantive rules which are the equivalent of VA regulations and must be considered.  See also YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 398-99 (1998).  \r\n\r\nIn adjudicating a claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, the Board is required to evaluate the supporting evidence in light of the places, types, and circumstances of service, as evidenced by the veteran's military records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) (2008); see also Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993).  The Board must analyze and weigh the probative value and assess the credibility of the relevant evidence and provide a statement of reasons for accepting or rejecting the evidence.  See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 26 (1991); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 169-70 (1991); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 59 (1990).  The Board may not base a decision on its own unsubstantiated medical conclusions but, rather, may reach a medical conclusion only on the basis of independent medical evidence in the record or adequate quotation from recognized medical treatises.  See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).  \r\n\r\nAs some of the Veteran's STRs are missing, VA has a heightened obligation \"to consider the applicability of the benefit of the doubt rule, to assist the claimant in developing the claim, and to explain its decision.\"  Cromer v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 215, 217-18 (2005) citing Russo v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 46, 51 (1996).  See also Cuevas v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 542, 548 (1992).\r\n\r\nHowever, no presumption, either in favor of the claimant or against VA, arises when there are lost or missing STRs.  See Cromer, 19 Vet. App. at 217-18 (Court declined to apply an \"adverse presumption\" against VA where records had been lost or destroyed while in Government control because bad faith or negligent destruction of the documents had not been shown). \r\n\r\nPTSD\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that she has PTSD due to two events that she experienced in service, including a sexual assault by another soldier that allegedly occurred in 1974, and from witnessing the accidental death of civilian at a military installation where she was stationed in 1982.  The Veteran contends that she has had trouble sleeping and periods of depression ever since the rape incident, and that she does not like to be around men or in small rooms.  \r\n\r\nInitially, it should be noted that the Board has thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, all the evidence submitted by the Veteran or on her behalf.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the veteran).  \r\n\r\nIn deciding a claim for service connection on the merits, the Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the Veteran's statements and the medical evidence to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.  See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 26 (1991); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 169-70 (1991); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 59 (1990).  \r\n\r\nConcerning the Veteran's contentions, while she is competent to provide evidence regarding her experiences and observations, any such assertions must be weighed against other inconsistent or contradictory evidence of record.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Maxon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 453, 459 (1999), affirmed sub nom Maxon v. Gober, 230 F. 3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (it was proper to consider the Veteran's entire medical history, including a lengthy period of absence of complaints). \r\n\r\nRegarding the alleged rape incident, the Board notes that the Veteran has given numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements concerning the alleged perpetrator and the circumstances of the incident, which raise serious questions as to her ability to provide accurate and reliable information and reflects negatively on her credibility.  Specifically, on her initial VA psychiatric examination in March 1984, the Veteran made no mention of the alleged rape and reported that she was discharged from service in December 1974, because she was pregnant.  Likewise, the Veteran made no mention of the rape incident when hospitalized at a VA facility in August 1990, and reported that she experienced some post-partum depression after the birth of her first child in 1975.  \r\n\r\nWhen examined by VA in August 1992, the Veteran reported that, in 1974, she was raped by a serviceman with whom she was having an affair.  She said that the rape occurred during a period in their relationship when they were attempting to reconcile following an earlier estrangement.  The Veteran also reported that she was married at that time, but said that she didn't report the incident because she feared that she would be put on trial for her actions instead of the serviceman.  \r\n\r\nHowever, when seen by VA psychiatric services in February 1995, the Veteran reported that she was raped by her commanding officer (CO).  In a letter received in February 1997, the Veteran reported that she was on duty on a holiday weekend while stationed at Ft. Devens in 1974, and was checking the rooms at the training facility when her NCO (noncommissioned officer) asked to speak to her in his office.  After she entered the room, he locked the door and closed the blinds, but that she had no memory of what happened after that until \"he let me out of the office.\"  She said that she didn't tell her husband or anyone else about the incident, but that she got pregnant from the encounter and was subsequently discharged from service in December 1974.  \r\n\r\nOn VA examination in June 1997, the Veteran reported that she was raped by her CO, but had no memories of the incident; though she did have a flashback of the man touching her body sometime in 1994.  About the incident, she recalled crying uncontrollably when she left the room, and that she shed her clothes immediately in the car when her husband picked her up, but that she didn't tell anyone about the encounter.  She said that the CO came to her at some later point and apologized for the incident, verifying to her that something happened.  \r\n\r\nAt an RO hearing in December 1997, the Veteran testified that she was raped by another soldier, an E-7 by the name of T.F., and that he worked in the same department but in another area of the building.  She testified that the rape occurred on a holiday weekend - maybe in September or October, but that she couldn't recall exactly which month.  She said that the soldier asked to speak to her in private and that they went into an office, where he locked the door and closed the blinds.  She could not remember what happened after he turned and looked at her, until she left the room to get away from him.  She was sure that some kind of sexual event occurred because she came down with a very bad infection two days after the incident.  (T p. 2-4).  She testified that she did not tell her husband or anyone else about the incident, and that she first sought psychiatric counseling in November or December 1975, and that it was another year before she felt comfortable enough with the counselor to talk about the incident.  (T p.7).  \r\n\r\nIn a letter received in January 1998, the Veteran reported that she may have been mistaken as to the name of the soldier who raped her, and said that she thought his name might have been someone with a different last name as reported in December 1997.\r\n\r\nWhen examined by VA in June 1998, the Veteran reported that she sought psychiatric counseling in 1975, and that she \"finally remembered [she] was raped about a year after that.\"  \r\n\r\nAt a hearing before a member of the Board at the RO in New Orleans in May 2000, the Veteran testified that the soldier who raped her was a sergeant first class (E-7) and was a good friend, but that she didn't report the incident because she didn't think anyone would believe her and that it would be difficult to prove that she was raped.  (T p.5).  \r\n\r\nIn a letter received in May 2005, the Veteran reported that she \"didn't receive assistance when [she] reported the rape in 1974 to a mental health worker and believed that [she] would not get assistance then.\"  She also stated that she reported the incident to her CO, executive officer (XO), and to her first sergeant, but that they told her to do her work and to try and not to think about it.  \r\n\r\nIn a letter received in February 2008, the Veteran reported that she first sought psychiatric counseling in 1974, and that after about a year, she felt comfortable enough to confide to her about the rape.  \r\n\r\nThus, the Veteran has provided inconsistent and contradictory statements concerning the circumstances of the alleged rape and her actions subsequent to the alleged incident, vis-\ufffd-vis, was raped by her CO, her XO, her NCO, a good friend, or a former lover; that she never told anyone; that she reported it to her immediate chain of command; that she sought medical treatment; that she didn't seek medical treatment, etcetera.  Unfortunately, the Board finds that she is not a reliable historian or a credible witness, and declines to assign any evidentiary weight to her contentions concerning this event.\r\n\r\nConcerning the incident in which she witnessed the accidental death of a civilian worker on base in 1982, the Board notes that an April 1994 letter from the Department of the Air Force, received from the Veteran in December 1994, and previously considered, was to the effect that any investigation reports pertaining to that incident would have been destroyed and were not available.  The letter indicated that a search for those records was unsuccessful, and that the Air Force regulations required that such records were to be maintained for three years, and then destroyed.  The evidence of record includes a copy of a newspaper article confirming that a civilian was killed when he fell into a hole at a construction site in February 1982.  \r\n\r\nAs the Veteran was stationed at the military facility where accident occurred, it is possible that she could have witnessed the accident.  In her 1983 RHM, the Veteran reported seeing a boy killed.  Therefore, this stressor incident has been conceded.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs for her first period of active service from December 1973 to December 1974, are unavailable despite extensive efforts by the RO to obtain those records from the National Personnel Records Center, the Service Department, through dependent records under the name of her former husband (also a former service member), and from the service hospitals and clinics where the Veteran reported treatment.  The evidentiary record includes a copy of her December 1973 service enlistment examination, which was entirely normal.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs for her second period of service are of record.  On a Report of Medical History (RMH) for enlistment in February 1981, the Veteran reported a history of treatment for post-partum depression sometime in late 1975, but denied any history of nervous trouble, loss of memory or trouble sleeping.  No pertinent abnormalities were noted on examination at that time, and the Veteran's psychiatric status was normal.  \r\n\r\nThe STRs showed that the Veteran was seen for emotional stress causing psycho-physiological abdominal cramps in November 1981.  She was also seen for stress related to school and for personal and marital problems on several occasions from January to May 1982, and was recommended to attend stress management class.  Those records did not reflect any complaints concerning the accidental death incident (or alleged rape).  The Veteran was seen for stress problems related to marital difficulties on several occasions while stationed in Germany in August, October and November 1982; her husband and children were stateside, however, no diagnoses was rendered.  On a RMH for separation from service in March 1983, the Veteran reported a history of depression, nervous trouble, and loss of memory, and indicated that she had been separated from her husband and children for two years, and that he had filed for legal separation and custody of their children.  She also reported that she witnessed a 19-year old boy get killed, and that these problems caused her to drink heavily and to become depressed.  On examination, the Veteran's psychiatric status was normal and no pertinent abnormalities were noted.  \r\n\r\nOn her original application for VA compensation benefits, received in December 1983, the Veteran reported that she was treated for \"emotional problem\" in service in December 1981, and February and November 1982.  The Veteran made no mention of any treatment during her first period of service or prior to 1981.  \r\n\r\nThe evidentiary record includes numerous private medical records showing treatment primarily for psychiatric problems and alcohol abuse from October 1985 to March 1988, including a hospital admission from April 1987 to March 1988.  The diagnoses at discharge in March 1988 included dysthymic disorder and borderline personality disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe evidentiary record also includes numerous VA medical records showing treatment for various maladies, including psychiatric problems from 1988 to 2011.  The diagnoses on a VA discharge summary report in September 1990, included bipolar disorder - mixed, and anxiety disorder.  On VA outpatient note in February 1992, the diagnosis was histrionic personality disorder with antisocial and narcissistic traits.  A VA psychiatric outpatient note in February 1995, showed that the Veteran was referred to the clinic for evaluation of PTSD due to rape.  The diagnoses included bipolar disorder, PTSD and panic disorder.  Outpatient notes from 2003 to 2001, showed that the Veteran was seen on a regular basis in the mental health program.  The diagnoses included bipolar disorder and PTSD.  Concerning the outpatient notes that included the diagnoses of PTSD, none of the reports included any discussion or analysis as to the basis for the diagnoses rendered.  \r\n\r\nA letter from a VA treating clinical psychologist, dated in July 2004, noted that the Veteran had been in the VA mental health program since 1994, and had been treated for her mental conditions since 1987.  The psychologist indicated that the Veteran was being treated for bipolar disorder and PTSD, and included a description of the impact that her mental conditions had on her life and employment.  The report did not include a description of the underlying cause of her symptoms, or any discussion or analysis as to the basis for the diagnoses.  \r\n\r\nThe evidentiary record showed that the Veteran was examined by VA psychiatric services on numerous occasions, including in March 1984, February 1992, June 1997 and 1998, January 2009, and October 2011.  Significantly, the conclusion reached by all of the examiners on all of those reports was that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  On the March 1984 psychiatric examination, the diagnosis was depressive neurosis or dysthymic disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe diagnosis on the August 1992 psychiatric examination was major depression interspersed with recurrent mania, first precipitated by post-partum, and alcohol abuse secondary to bipolar disorder.  The physician commented that the Veteran had a tendency to drink excessively when in a manic state, so that her drinking takes the form of binging.  \r\n\r\nAn examination report by a VA social worker in August 1992, also found that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The social worker noted that the Veteran tended to blame all of her interpersonal and interactional problems on other people, family, the military, the bureaucracy, etc., and at no time demonstrated any ability to take responsibility for her role with some of her problems.  She noted that, while the Veteran reported some symptoms of PTSD, those symptoms also supported a diagnosis of anxiety disorder or major depression.  Given the Veteran's conflicting information and diagnostic findings, the social worker opined that there was no support for a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nOn VA psychiatric examination in June 1997, the examiner stated that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, and that the symptoms she described seemed to affect her only in a minor way.  The diagnoses include bipolar disorder and agoraphobia without history of panic disorder.  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the VA examiner in June 1998 noted that, while the Veteran reported some symptoms of PTSD related to a rape and witnessing a person killed in service, she did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The diagnoses including bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse, in remission.  \r\n\r\nFollowing extensive psychological testing in January 2009, a VA psychologist concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The diagnoses included bipolar disorder, gambling addiction and generalized anxiety disorder.  The examiner noted that, while the Veteran reported that the rape had the greater overall impact on her life, she did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD based on either of her reported stressors (the other being witnessing the death of a construction worker).  \r\n\r\nIn July 2009, the Board remanded the appeal for a VA psychiatric examination by a panel of three Board-certified psychiatrists.  In a one-page report, dated in July 2010, a clinical psychologist indicated that the panel opinion was that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The psychologist indicated that the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) assessment showed that the Veteran met the criteria for PTSD.  She then stated that the Veteran meet criterion A for a stressor - witnessing the death of a construction worker; criterion B for the conceded stressor, and criterion C-E, though it could not be ascertained that this (criterion C-E) was related specifically to the conceded stressor.  The psychologist then opined that it was at least as likely as not that any pre-existing trauma related symptoms (i.e., in-service rape not currently conceded) would have been exacerbated by the conceded stressor.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the July 2010 VA examination, the Board finds that the psychologist's opinion is somewhat vague and confusing, and declines to assign any significant probative weight to the PTSD diagnosis.  Specifically, the psychologist's conclusion indicated that the Veteran met criterion A and B for the conceded stressor, but not criterion C-E.  She then attempts to satisfy the latter criterion (C-E) by suggesting that the conceded stressor aggravated the unverified stressor (alleged rape).  However, as discussed in great detail above, the Board does not find that the Veteran's stressor of the alleged rape in service is believable or credible.  Therefore, any diagnosis based on that stressor is of no probative value.  \r\n\r\nParenthetically, the Board notes that the author of July 2010 report, was a psychologist who treated the Veteran on several occasions beginning in 2003, and had rendered a diagnosis of PTSD on her first interview, without having reviewed the claims file, or offering any discussion of the alleged stressors or any analysis for her diagnosis.  It is also interesting to note that the author of the July 2010 report is the only treating outpatient clinician to offer a diagnosis of PTSD, other than a February 1995 outpatient report, when the Veteran was referred to the clinic specifically for treatment of \"PTSD due to rape.\"  Furthermore, with respect to the July 2010 report, while the psychologist indicated that she reviewed all volumes of the claims file, she offered no explanation for the Veteran's inconsistent and contradictory statements concerning the alleged rape or the fact that all of the VA examination reports that she \"thoroughly reviewed\" and suggested supported her opinion, failed to render a diagnosis of PTSD.  In fact, all of those reports found, specifically, that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, the Board notes that the only other medical report of record that included a diagnosis of PTSD was a VA outpatient note dated in February 1995.  Parenthetically, the diagnoses also included Bipolar disorder and panic disorder with agoraphobia.  While the report indicated that the Veteran underwent some psychological testing, there was no discussion or explanation of the test results.  Furthermore, the examiner did not review any other medical reports and did not offer any explanation or discussion as to the basis for the diagnoses render.  Thus, the Board finds that the report is of limited probative value.  \r\n\r\nIn August 2011, the Board found that the AMC did not comply with the directives of the July 2009 remand, and undertook additional development.  Specifically, in the July 2009 remand, the Board noted that the Veteran's extremely complicated medical history and multiple conflicting diagnoses, necessitated an evaluation by a panel of certified psychiatrists rather than psychologists, and then directed the AMC to have the Veteran examined by a panel of three psychiatrists.  Therefore, the Board remanded the appeal for a comprehensive psychiatric examination.  \r\n\r\nIn October 2011, the Veteran was examined by a panel of three VA psychiatrists.  The report reflects that the claims file was reviewed and included a detailed description of the Veteran's complaints, medical history and the clinical and diagnostic findings on examination.  The psychiatrist's concluded that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criterion under DSM-TR-IV for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The diagnoses included borderline personality disorder and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified.  \r\n\r\nThe examiners indicated that the symptoms attributable to the Veteran's borderline personality disorder included a lifelong pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging, alcohol abuse, pathological gambling, recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures or threat, or self-mutilation (Veteran's history revealed presence of each of these), affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days, and inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (Veteran's history included episodes of rage, anger and recurrent physical fights).  The Veteran's anxiety disorder was manifested by episodes of severe anxiety, concentration, sleep problems, irritability, and excessive worrying/ruminating.  \r\n\r\nAs noted above, service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition, (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptomatology and the claimed, in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nBased on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the totality of the competent, credible evidence is against the claim of service connection for PTSD.  As noted above, in order to prevail on a claim of service connection for PTSD, there must be a PTSD diagnosis which conforms the DSM-IV criteria.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board finds the October 2011 VA panel opinion the most persuasive evidence as to whether the Veteran manifests PTSD.  In this respect, the opinion was based upon a longitudinal review of the claims file which included a discussion of all relevant facts.  The psychiatrists offered a rational and plausible explanation for concluding that the Veteran does not have PTSD that is related to service.  See Wray v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 488, 493 (1995); see also Preteen v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000) (factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion include the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.).  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Board finds that the July 2010 VA opinion diagnosing PTSD is less persuasive, as it did not include any discussion or analysis of the facts, and offered only a convoluted conclusory opinion with respect to criterion C-E.  Similarly, the October 2011 VA panel opinion holds substantially more probative weight than the PTSD diagnoses in the clinical setting which do not separately discuss how the PTSD criteria have been met which, while presumed as conforming to DSM-IV, lacks any rationale to determine how the conclusion was reached.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (holding that a medical opinion does not hold probative value when it fails to provide sufficient detail and rationale to allow the Board to make a fully informed evaluation of the disability).\r\n\r\nThe Board has also considered the July 2007 letter from the Veteran's ex-mother-in-law to the effect that she recalled that the Veteran was irritable and angry when they visited her over the Columbus Day holiday in 1974, and that she wished she had questioned the Veteran about her obvious emotional problems at that time.  Additionally, the Board has considered the self-diagnosis provided by the Veteran in this case.  Neither the Veteran nor her mother is shown to possess the medical expertise necessary to render a psychiatric diagnosis which, in this case, is clearly complicated and required an opinion from three Board-certified psychiatrists.  In any event, the Board finds that the opinion from these three Board-certified psychiatrists holds significantly greater probative weight than the opinions offered by the Veteran and her mother, as the Board-certified psychiatrists are shown to possess significantly more training and expertise than the Veteran and her mother to diagnose and reconcile psychiatric diagnoses.\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the totality of the competent, credible evidence is against the claim of service connection for PTSD.  As noted above, in order to prevail on a claim of service connection for PTSD, a threshold matter is whether the Veteran manifests PTSD.  Here, there are competing opinions as to whether the Veteran manifests PTSD under DSM-IV criteria and the Board finds that the Veteran does not manifest PTSD.  Unlike McClain, this is not a case where a diagnosis is conceded as established at one time and become asymptomatic.  Rather, the Board finds that the Veteran has never manifested PTSD.  Accordingly, the claim is denied.  \r\n\r\nThe benefit of the doubt has been considered, but there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue on appeal.  Therefore, that doctrine is not for application in this case because the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nT.

His hearing request has been properly withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.702(e) (2011).\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2011).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1. The Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss.\r\n\r\n2. He is competent to report the circumstances of his service and his symptoms, but his testimony is not credible.\r\n\r\n3. The report of a March 2008 VA audiological consultation is competent evidence that the Veteran does not experience hearing disability as the result of his active duty service.\r\n\r\n4. The preponderance of the evidence reflects that the Veteran does not have hearing loss due to any incident of his active duty service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1154, 5103, 5103A, 5107(b) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.385 (2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Board will discuss the relevant law which it is required to apply. This includes statutes published in Title 38, United States Code (\"38 U.S.C.A.\"); regulations published in the Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\"38 C.F.R.\") and the precedential rulings of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (as noted by citations to \"Fed. Cir.\") and the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (as noted by citations to \"Vet. App.\").\r\n\r\nThe Board is bound by statute to set forth specifically the issue under appellate consideration and its decision must also include separately stated findings of fact and conclusions of law on all material issues of fact and law presented on the record, and the reasons or bases for those findings and conclusions. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7104(d); see also 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 19.7 (implementing the cited statute); see also Vargas-Gonzalez v. West, 12 Vet. App. 321, 328 (1999); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 56-57 (1990) (the Board's statement of reasons and bases for its findings and conclusions on all material facts and law presented on the record must be sufficient to enable the claimant to understand the precise basis for the Board's decision, as well as to facilitate review of the decision by courts of competent appellate jurisdiction. The Board must also consider and discuss all applicable statutory and regulatory law, as well as the controlling decisions of the appellate courts).\r\n\r\nDuties to Assist and Notify\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) describes VA's duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 and 3.326(a) (2011).\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the Veteran and her representative, if any, of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002). Proper VCAA notice must inform the Veteran of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide. See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b)(1).\r\n\r\nA July 2008 pre-adjudication letter explained the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim for service connection. The letter also notified him how a disability rating is determined for a service-connected disorder and the basis for determining an effective date upon the grant of any benefit sought, in compliance with Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 490-491 (2006). This letter was provided to the Veteran prior to the initial adjudication of his claim, pursuant to Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004). \r\n\r\nVA has a duty to assist veterans in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate their claims. The claims file contains service treatment records and reports of post-service medical treatment. Although the Veteran's personnel record is not within the claims file, the record reflects that the RO took appropriate steps to attempt to obtain that evidence, issued a November 2009 formal finding as to unavailability of the personnel record, and notified the Veteran as to the status of his records in a November 2009 letter. See Dixon v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 261, 263-264 (1992). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not been afforded a VA medical examination with respect to his claim for service connection. However, a VA examination is not necessary in order to decide this claim. In McClendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet App. 79 (2006), the Court held that, in disability compensation claims, the Secretary must provide a VA medical examination when there is: (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. Id. at 81. Here, the record does not indicate that hearing loss may be associated with the Veteran's service and there is sufficient competent medical evidence on file as a comprehensive audiological evaluation was conducted in March 2008.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Veteran's contention that he experiences hearing loss as a result of his active duty service, lay testimony can serve to establish an association between service and the claimed disability or death for the purpose of satisfying the criteria of McClendon. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). For example, a lay person may be competent to offer testimony on certain medical matters, such as describing symptoms observable to the naked eye, or even diagnosing simple conditions such as a dislocated shoulder, and their lay testimony as to a continuity of symptomatology can satisfy the requirements of McClendon. However, a lay person is not competent to offer an opinion on a matter clearly requiring medical expertise, such as linking current health problems to in-service  exposures. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). \r\n\r\nThis is not a case in which the Veteran's lay assertions, alone, can serve to establish any association between any current hearing problem and claimed in-service noise exposure. An examination is not warranted under the criteria set forth in McClendon. See Wells v. Principi, 326 F. 3d 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not made the RO or the Board aware of any additional evidence that needs to be obtained in order to fairly decide his claim. He has been given ample opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of his claim. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.655, all relevant evidence necessary for an equitable disposition of the Veteran's appeal of these issues has been obtained and the case is ready for appellate review. The Board additionally finds that general due process considerations have been complied with by VA. See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.103 (2011).\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for a hearing disability claimed as the result of in-service noise exposure. Although his service records reflect that the Veteran served in the Air Force as a ground communications repairman, there is no competent, probative evidence supporting his claim. The Board must deny his claim. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102.\r\n\r\nThe Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). However, although an obligation to provide sufficient reasons and bases in support of an appellate decision exists, there is no need to discuss, in detail, all of the evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his or her behalf. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the entire record must be reviewed, but each piece of evidence does not have to be discussed). The analysis in this decision focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence, and on what the evidence shows or fails to show with respect to the issues on appeal. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a \"competent\" source. The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 at 308 (2007) (Observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.  \r\n\r\nCompetent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159. Lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when:\r\n\r\n(1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition (i.e., when the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer);\r\n\r\n(2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or;\r\n\r\n (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  \r\n\r\nJandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (where widow seeking service connection for cause of death of her husband, the Veteran, the Court holding that medical opinion not required to prove nexus between service connected mental disorder and drowning which caused Veteran's death).   \r\n\r\nIn ascertaining the competency of lay evidence, the Courts have generally held that a layperson is not capable of opining on matters requiring medical knowledge.  Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183 (1997). In certain instances, however, lay evidence has been found to be competent with regard to a disease with \"unique and readily identifiable features\" that is \"capable of lay observation.\" See, e.g., Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (concerning varicose veins); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a dislocated shoulder); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002) (tinnitus); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398 (1995) (flatfeet). Laypersons have also been found to not be competent to provide evidence in more complex medical situations. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007) (concerning rheumatic fever).  \r\n\r\nCompetent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. Competent medical evidence may also include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises. It also includes statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(a)(1).\r\n\r\nAfter determining the competency and credibility of evidence, the Board must then weigh its probative value. In this function, the Board may properly consider internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-512 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (table); see Madden v. Brown, 125 F.3d 1447 (Fed Cir. 1997) (holding that the Board has the \"authority to discount the weight and probative value of evidence in light of its inherent characteristics in its relationship to other items of evidence\").\r\n\r\nEstablishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed.Cir.1996) (table); see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  \r\n\r\nDemonstration of continuity of symptomatology is an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden/Caluza elements under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b). Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999).  \r\n\r\nContinuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology. Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; see Hickson, 12 Vet. App. at 253 (lay evidence of in-service incurrence sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385.\r\n\r\nA lack of evidence that a claimant exhibited hearing loss during service is not fatal to a claim for service connection. The laws and regulations do not require in-service complaints of, or treatment for, hearing loss in order to establish service connection. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet.App. 87, 89 (1992). Instead, as noted by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court):\r\n\r\n[W]here the regulatory threshold requirements for hearing disability are not met until several years after separation from service, the record must include evidence of exposure to disease or injury in service that would adversely affect the auditory system and post- service test results meeting the criteria of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385... For example, if the record shows (a) acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service and audiometric test results reflecting an upward shift in tested thresholds in service, though still not meeting the requirements for \"disability\" under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385, and (b) post-service audiometric testing produces findings meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385, rating authorities must consider whether there is a medically sound basis to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service, or whether they are more properly attributable to intercurrent causes.\r\n\r\nHensley v. Brown, 5 Vet.App. 155, 159 (1993) (quoting from a brief of the VA Secretary).\r\n\r\nHere, the Veteran's active duty service treatment records reflect normal hearing at the time of his entry into service. The records are silent for any complaints of hearing difficulty and his hearing was again tested as normal at the time of his discharge. \r\n\r\nHe reported hearing difficulties to his VA care providers in 2008 and was referred for an audiological consultation. In March 2008, his hearing was assessed by a VA audiologist. The audiologist noted that the Veteran reported experiencing a slow decline in his hearing over the \"last couple of years.\" The consultation report reflects that the Veteran reported working as a repairman and repairing machines in a variety of industrial settings including textile mills and oil rigs. He also reported recreational noise exposure with carpentry and construction. Audiological testing showed a bilateral hearing disability pursuant to VA criteria. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.385. The audiologist noted normal hearing acuity through 2000 Hz with a mild degree sensorineural hearing loss at 3000 Hz, then sloping gently to moderate after 4000 Hz, and excellent speech recognition ability. The audiologist diagnosed high frequency sensorineural hearing loss consistent with presbycusis. Presbycusis is a \"lessening of hearing acuteness resulting from degenerative changes in the ear that occur especially in old age [] and diabetes.\" Godfrey v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 113, 120-21 (1995).  \r\n\r\nIn July 2008, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss. He reported on his claim form that hearing loss began in November 1958. \r\n\r\nIn August 2009, the Veteran stated that his hearing loss was due to his military job assignment. He wrote to VA in October 2009 and reported that he spent time during service repairing equipment that was located on the flight line at times when jets were touching down and taking off. He also stated that he had never worked on textile machines or on oil rigs and that he did not have excellent speech recognition. \r\n\r\nIn January 2010, he wrote that he experienced a decline in his hearing over the last \"several years, not couple of years.\" He estimated that he had spent more than 2000 hours on standby in an airfield during his active duty service and that he was outside near the planes unless he was completing an inside repair. He stated that \"there is no way this could not affect a person's hearing at that time or in later years.\" He reiterated those contentions in a May 2010 statement.\r\n\r\nThere is no medical evidence correlating the Veteran's current complaints of hearing loss to an incident of his active duty service. Although the Veteran is competent to report in-service acoustic trauma, he is not competent to render a probative (persuasive) opinion on a medical matter. See Bostain, 11 Vet. App. at 127, citing Espiritu, 2 Vet. App. 492. He has reported exposure to loud aircraft noises during his active duty service and his DD-214 supports his contention that he worked near aircraft. However, service medical records reveal normal hearing at the time of his discharge and show that he had no ear complaints at that time. Unlike in Hensley, there are no audiometric test results reflecting any upward shift in hearing thresholds in service. 5 Vet.App. at 159.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Veteran has made conflicting statements about when he began to experience hearing loss. On his July 2008 claim, he stated that hearing loss began in 1958, but he informed the March 2008 audiologist that he had only experienced hearing loss for a \"couple years,\" and he stated in January 2010 that he experienced hearing loss for \"several years, not couple of years.\" VA cannot ignore a veteran's testimony simply because the veteran is an interested party, but his personal interest may affect the credibility of the evidence.  See Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991). Due to the internal inconsistency of his statements, the Board finds his testimony not credible. Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 511-512. As the Veteran has stated, and medical evidence reflects, that he did not begin to experience hearing loss during service, a finding of chronicity is refuted. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b).\r\n\r\nHis lay statements aside, no medical professional has opined that the Veteran's current hearing disability is the result of his active duty service. The 2008 VA audiologist opined that he experienced presbycusis rather than hearing loss due to acoustic trauma. Further, the consultation report reflects that hearing loss was not manifested until decades after service and notes years of intervening post-service noise exposure. Although the Veteran has contended that he did not inform the audiologist that he had worked in textile mills or on oil rigs, the Board has found his testimony not credible. Regardless, as the Veteran did not contend that he did not have any post-service industrial and recreational noise exposure, and the audiologist diagnosed presbycusis, his contentions are of little probative value. Buchanan, 451 F.3d 1331.\r\n\r\nThe Board accords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt where there exists an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter. 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b) (West 2002); Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996); Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993). Here, although the Veteran is competent to discuss the circumstances of his service, he is not competent to render a medical opinion. Bostain, 11 Vet. App. at 127. Service treatment records show no hearing impairment and a lack of complaint of hearing problems. Medical evidence shows that the Veteran began to experience presbycusis many years after service and after approximately 30 years of industrial and recreational noise exposure. The only evidence supporting the Veteran's claim are his lay statements, which the Board has found not credible. \r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against the claim and the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application. See 38 U.S.C.A.\ufffd 5107(b); Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990). The claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nVito A.

Taylor, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from September 1962 to April 1966.\r\n\r\nThis case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision in April 2008 by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  \r\n\r\nIn February 2012, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for further development.  The requested actions were taken and the case has since been returned to the Board for adjudication.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been variously diagnosed with depression not otherwise specified (NOS), anxiety disorder NOS, major depressive disorder, and adjustment disorder.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  Thus, the Board has recharacterized the claim on appeal to entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.\r\n\r\nThis appeal also initially included the issue of the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  Service connection for PTSD was denied by the Board in \r\nFebruary 2012.  According to the record, the Veteran has not appealed this denial to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) nor filed a motion for revision of the prior Board decision based on clear and unmistakable error.  Under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1100, the February 2012 Board decision is considered final.\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that additional VA treatment records have been added to the claims folder following the most recent Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) in October 2012.  However, in November 2012, the Veteran and his representative submitted a waiver of initial RO consideration of any new evidence. See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1304 (2013).\r\n\r\nThe Virtual VA paperless claims processing system contains a brief from the Veteran's representative dated in June 2014 and VA treatment records dated from August 2010 to November 2012, and in May 2013.  Other documents on the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system are either duplicative of the evidence of record or not pertinent to the present appeal.  Documents on the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) are either duplicative of the evidence of record or not pertinent to the present appeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that there is a nexus between a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder and service, or that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nAn acquired psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service and was not caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131, 1111, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.310 (2013). \r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  Stegall Concerns \r\n\r\nAs noted in the Introduction, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, in February 2012 for additional evidentiary development.  In particular, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim for an addendum opinion.  After obtaining the addendum opinion, the AMC then readjudicated the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder in an October 2012 SSOC.\r\n\r\nThus, the Board's prior remand instructions have been complied with.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998) [where the remand orders of the Board are not complied with, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance].\r\n\r\nII.  Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA)\r\n\r\nThe VCAA, codified in part at 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A, and implemented in part at 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159, amended VA's duties to notify and to assist a claimant in developing information and evidence necessary to substantiate the claim. \r\n\r\n      Duty to Notify\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b), when VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, it will notify the claimant of (1) any information and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim, (2) what portion of the information and evidence VA will obtain, and (3) what portion of the information and evidence the claimant is to provide.  \r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice requirements apply to all five elements of a service connection claim.  The five elements are: (1) veteran status; (2) existence of a disability; (3) a connection between the veteran's service and the disability; (4) degree of disability; and (5) effective date of the disability.  Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe VCAA notice must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable adjudication by the RO.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).  \r\n\r\nThe RO provided pre-adjudication VCAA notice by letters dated in December 2007 and November 2008.  These letters notified the Veteran of the evidence needed to substantiate the claims for service connection, as well as what information and evidence must be submitted by the Veteran, what information and evidence would be obtained by VA, and the provisions for disability ratings and for the effective date of the claim.  Additionally, a February 2010 VCAA letter notified the Veteran of the evidence needed to substantiate a claim for secondary service connection.\r\n\r\n      Duty to Assist\r\n\r\nVA has fulfilled its duty to assist in obtaining identified and available evidence needed to substantiate the claim.  Service treatment records, post-service treatment records, and lay statements have been associated with the record.  As discussed above, a VA examination was obtained in March 2010, whereby the examiner reviewed the Veteran's claims file, examined the Veteran, and provided an opinion.  Pursuant to a February 2012 Board remand, in March 2012, an addendum opinion was provided.  Taken as a whole, the VA medical opinions provided were thorough and fully adequate.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  \r\n\r\nAs the Veteran has not identified any additional evidence pertinent to the claim, the Board concludes that no further assistance to the Veteran in developing the facts pertinent to the claim is required to comply with the duty to assist.\r\n\r\nIII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nA veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1110.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called \"nexus\" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nService connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated by service.  This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a). \r\n\r\nIn order to show a chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word \"chronic.\"  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support a claim. There must be competent medical evidence unless the evidence relates to a condition as to which lay observation is competent to identify its existence.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) (2013).\r\n\r\nA recent decision of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit Court), however, clarified that this notion of continuity of symptomatology since service under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b), which as mentioned is an alternative means of establishing the required nexus or linkage between current disability and service, only applies to conditions identified as chronic under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).  \r\n\r\nService connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310(a).  Service connection may also be established by the degree of disability resulting from aggravation of a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App.439, 448 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  Acquired Psychiatric Disability\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is seeking service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.  He essentially contends that he has an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, from his service while stationed in Vietnam.  He also contends that his acquired psychiatric disorder may be related to his service-connected disabilities, to include his diabetes mellitus type II.\r\n\r\nThe service treatment records were negative for complaints of or treatment for a psychiatric disorder.  At the time of the Veteran's separation examination in April 1966, there was no indication that the Veteran had a psychiatric disorder at that time.  He was found to be clinically normal upon mental status examination.\r\n\r\nPost-service VA treatment records showed that the Veteran retired in December 2006 after working as a railroad car man and a school custodian.  In October 2007, he was referred for a mental health assessment after reporting increased intrusive thoughts since retirement.  The Veteran reported that his primary complaint was \"too much free time\" since retiring.  He also indicated that a friend had recently passed away.  The Veteran further noted his attempts to avoid certain activities, places, or people that reminded him of his stressor event in Vietnam.  In particular, he indicated that he attempted to avoid people of Asian descent by avoiding restaurants that serve Asian food and avoiding a neighbor who appears to be of Asian descent.  He indicated that this symptoms caused him distress and mild disruption of his activities.  He noted that he avoided talking to people about his military experiences.  The examiner found that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder with anxious features, secondary to his retirement, and exacerbated by the death of his friend.  The Veteran had a negative depression screen.  \r\n\r\nVarious VA treatment records dated from September 2007 to October 2008 showed diagnoses of depression NOS, recurrent major depressive disorder, anxiety NOS, and alcohol abuse in full sustained remission.  The Axis IV diagnoses all pertained to the Veteran's retirement, death of an old friend, and lack of structure and activity.  In a May 2008 mental health progress note, the Veteran indicated that when he returned from Vietnam, he drank heavily to \"cope with experiences.\"  He reported occasional intrusive memories and hypervigilance.  He also reported that after attending his friend's funeral in 2007, he felt more depressed and isolative.  In an August 2008 mental health progress note, the Veteran reported that he was attempting to cope with recent life changes (retirement) and the loss of a close friend in February 2007.  The Veteran indicated that he was treated with Prozac after his father died in 1998 and he reported thoughts of suicide after his friend died.  \r\n\r\nIn a VA treatment record dated in February 2009, the Veteran reported that things continued to go well, with the exception of one night when he could not sleep.  He indicated that he started thinking about the war and painful events that happened, and then felt alone.  In a VA treatment record dated in July 2009, it was noted that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms had largely resolved.  The Veteran also reported that he was \"doing great.\"\r\n\r\nIn a VA examination dated in March 2010, the Veteran reported that he began receiving mental health treatment at the VA in 2006 or 2007.  He indicated that he has been on anti-depressants since this time, and also utilizes individual psychotherapy.  The Veteran reported that he had not had any symptoms of depression since he had been taking his medications; however, prior to taking medication, he was extremely depressed and suicidal.  He reported his belief that he began having problems with depression after his father and two good friends died.  He indicated that these events led to feelings of depression.  He also reported that after his retirement as head custodian at a high school, he began feeling lonely and isolated.  The examiner diagnosed depression NOS in remission and alcohol dependency in full sustained remission.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner noted that when she asked the Veteran how his depression was related to service, he said \"Nam.\"  The Veteran indicated that he road shotgun when driving in Vietnam to get supplies and \"that almost blew his mind.\"  He also reported that they were treated like \"shit\" when they returned from Vietnam.  The examiner noted that when she asked the Veteran if his health affected his depression, he stated, \"I don't know I am not a doctor\" and \"I am not happy I am a diabetic, I'll tell you that.\"  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that he began experiencing depression after his father and friend died, and after he retired from work, because he appeared to be more isolated after retirement and was grieving the losses.  The examiner found that the Veteran did not indicate that his depression was related to or caused by his service-connected disabilities.  She opined that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's depression was secondary to his service-connected disabilities.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the February 2012 Board remand, the March 2010 VA examiner provided an addendum opinion.  The examiner wrote that throughout the interview, the Veteran presented a number of current life stressors that he related to his problems with depression.  She noted that during the interview, he reported his belief that he began having problems with depression after his father and a good friend died within two weeks of another, and another good friend died that same year, leading to feelings of depression.  She noted that the Veteran also reported that he had retired as head custodian at a high school, which left him feeling lonely and isolated after losing contact with others at work.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not mention his experiences in Vietnam as a reason for his depression until she asked him why he thought his depression was related to service.  The examiner wrote that the Veteran stated that he road shotgun when driving in Vietnam to get supplies, which almost blew his mind.  She noted that he also stated that they were treated like \"shit\" when they came back.  The examiner indicated that although poor treatment of Vietnam veterans upon return from service is well documented, the Veteran presented several other notable reasons for his depression.  She further indicated that the Veteran reportedly first sought mental health treatment in 2006 or 2007 at the VA, which was over 30 years after his return from Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner found that the evidence suggests that the Veteran's depression was less likely as not related to service experiences.  She found that he presented several other reasons for his current depression, including loss of family and friends and loss of positive daily interaction with others due to his retirement.  The examiner opined that it was also less likely as not that the Veteran's depression was aggravated because there was no known diagnosis of depression prior to 2006.\r\n\r\nAs to the issue of secondary service connection, the examiner indicated that throughout the assessment, the Veteran did not make statements concerning how his physical health may or may not affect his mood.  She noted that when she specifically asked the Veteran if his health affected his depression, he stated, \"I don't know I am not a doctor\" and \"I am not happy I am a diabetic, I'll tell you that.\"  She noted that although the Veteran indicated that he was not happy about his diabetes, he did not suggest that his history of suicidal thoughts and symptoms of depression were aggravated or caused by his diabetes.  She indicated that the Veteran's main focus throughout the assessment had been on several life events that had resulted in a depressed mood after his father and friends died, and after he retired from work.  The examiner therefore found that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's depression was caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities, to include his diabetes.\r\n\r\nVA treatment records dated from August 2010 to November 2012 showed continued mental health treatment.  In May 2013, the Veteran reported good mental health function overall with minimal anxiety, depression or anger in the past six months.  The Veteran was diagnosed with anxiety disorder NOS (symptoms largely resolved) and depression NOS (symptoms largely resolved).\r\n\r\n\tAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show.  The Veteran should not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not specifically discussed herein.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).  The law requires only that the Board provide reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran. \r\n\r\nWhen considering the pertinent evidence of record in light of the above-noted legal authority, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is not warranted.\r\n\r\nWith respect to service connection on a direct basis, the Veteran has been diagnosed with depression NOS.  Accordingly, as there is a current acquired psychiatric disorder, the first Shedden element of service connection is satisfied.  However, a veteran seeking disability benefits must establish not only the existence of a disability, but also an etiological connection between his active duty service and the disability.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is etiologically related to the Veteran's active duty service on a direct basis.  \r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the lay evidence offered by the Veteran to VA.  This includes his statements, in which he asserted his belief that his acquired psychiatric disorder is related to his service.  In general, lay witnesses are competent to testify as to their observations as well as opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology in some circumstances.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (lay witnesses are competent to testify as to their observations, but this testimony must be weighed against the other evidence of record); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation).  See also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (Board's categorical statement that \"a valid medical opinion\" was required to establish nexus, and that a layperson was \"not competent\" to provide testimony as to nexus because she was a layperson, conflicts with Jandreau; lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has carefully considered the Veteran's lay assertions.  The Board acknowledges that a layman is competent to report what he or she experiences through one of the senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App 465, 470 (1994).  However, while the Veteran is competent to report psychiatric symptoms such as depressed mood, the diagnosis of depression NOS, requires that a person be qualified through education, training, or experience to offer a medical diagnosis.  For this reason, his acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as depression NOS, is not a simple medical condition and the Veteran is not competent to render a diagnosis.  Furthermore, the determination as to the etiology of depression NOS requires specialized training for a determination as to causation, and is therefore not susceptible of lay opinion.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159.  Here, there is no competent evidence or opinion even suggesting that there exists a medical nexus between a current acquired psychiatric disorder and the Veteran's active duty service.  In fact, the only medical opinions addressing the etiology of the acquired psychiatric disorder weigh against the claim.  Accordingly, the Board has placed greater probative weight on the conclusions reached by the March 2012 VA examiner, who, as a licensed psychologist, is competent to render opinions regarding medical matters.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the March 2012 addendum opinion offers the strongest and most persuasive opinion and rationale regarding the etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  This examiner reviewed the Veteran's entire claims file and medical history.  In formulating her opinion, the examiner found that the Veteran's currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder was less likely as not related to his in-service experiences.  She found, instead, that he presented several other reasons for his current depression, including loss of family and friends and loss of positive daily interaction with others due to his retirement.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not mention his experiences in Vietnam as a reason for his depression until she asked him why he thought his depression was related to service.  The Veteran stated that he road shotgun when driving in Vietnam to get supplies, which almost blew his mind.  He also stated that they were treated like \"shit\" when they came back.  The examiner indicated that although poor treatment of Vietnam veterans upon return from service is well documented, the Veteran presented several other notable reasons for his depression.  She further indicated that the Veteran reportedly first sought mental health treatment in 2006 or 2007 at the VA, which was over 30 years after his return from Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nThe Board also finds that various VA treatment records corroborate the March 2012 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is most likely due to the loss of his father and friends, and the loss of positive daily interaction with others due to his retirement.  For example, in October 2007, the Veteran was referred for a mental health assessment after reporting increased intrusive thoughts since retirement.  The Veteran reported that his primary complaint was \"too much free time\" since retiring.  He also indicated that a friend had recently passed away.  The examiner found that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder with anxious features, secondary to his retirement and exacerbated by the death of his friend.  Furthermore, in an August 2008 mental health progress note, the Veteran reported that he was attempting to cope with recent life changes (retirement) and the loss of a close friend in February 2007.  The Veteran indicated that he was treated with Prozac after his father died in 1998 and he reported thoughts of suicide after his friend died.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to service connection on a secondary basis, the evidence fails to show that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was either caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities, to include his diabetes mellitus, type II.  In this regard, the March 2012 VA examiner found that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's depression was caused by or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities, to include his diabetes.  In this regard, the examiner indicated that throughout the assessment, the Veteran did not make statements concerning how his physical health may or may not affect his mood.  She noted that when she specifically asked the Veteran if his health affected his depression, he stated, \"I don't know I am not a doctor\" and \"I am not happy I am a diabetic, I'll tell you that.\"  She noted that although the Veteran indicated that he was not happy about his diabetes, he did not suggest that his history of suicidal thoughts and symptoms of depression were aggravated or caused by his diabetes.  She indicated that the Veteran's main focus throughout the assessment had been on several life events that had resulted in a depressed mood after his father and friends died, and after he retired from work.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds the March 2012 opinion to be adequate and reliable and affords it great probative weight.  Moreover, it stands uncontradicted by any other competent opinion of record.\r\n\r\nConsidering the above, the Board finds that the addendum opinion of the March 2012 examiner adequately explains why the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as depression NOS, is most likely due to the death of his father and friends and his retirement, rather than his service, or his service-connected disabilities.  The Board therefore finds that the expert opinion of the VA physician greatly outweighs any opinion of the Veteran regarding the onset and etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  As discussed, the etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder is a complex medical matter beyond the knowledge of a layperson.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (2007).  Therefore, whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was caused by service or secondary to a service-connected disability requires specialized training for a determination as to causation, and is therefore not susceptible of lay opinion.  The VA opinion is highly probative as it reflects the VA examiner's specialized knowledge, training, and experience as to the etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, as well as consideration of all relevant lay and medical evidence of record.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, the weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is etiologically related to his active duty service, to include as secondary to his service-connected disabilities.  As a result, service connection is not warranted.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(b).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDAVID L.

Drummer, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps during the Vietnam Era from July 1969 to December 1970.\r\n\r\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2010 rating decision issued by the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn a VA Form 21-4138 dated February 18, 2011, the Veteran referenced his right shoulder in conjunction with 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1151.  In a VA Form 9 received in October 2011, he stated that he had no issues with shoulder pain prior to open heart surgery and that the pain and the condition of his shoulder was a result of a pinched nerve as a result of VA surgery.  Accordingly, a claim for compensation for a right shoulder disorder pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1151 is referred to the RO for appropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's current right shoulder disability did not manifest during active service or within one year of service separation and was not related to any incident of service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability are not satisfied.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  VCAA Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nVA's duties to notify and assist under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) have been satisfied.  See 38 U.S.C.A \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015). \r\n\r\nAn August 2010 letter provided all notice required under the VCAA.  The letter notified the Veteran of the elements of service connection, the types of evidence that could support the claims, and the allocation of responsibilities between the Veteran and VA for obtaining relevant records and other evidence on his behalf.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b) (2015); see also Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183, 187 (2002).  The letter was followed by adequate time for the Veteran to submit information and evidence before initial adjudication or readjudication of this claim in statements of the case and supplemental statements of the case.  See Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328, 1333-34 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (VCAA notice must generally be provided prior to the initial rating decision); but see Mayfield v. Nicholson, 499 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a timing delay in VCAA notice is harmless if followed by readjudication of the claim after the claimant has had an appropriate time to respond); accord Prickett v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 370 (2006).  Accordingly, VA's duty to notify is satisfied. \r\n\r\nConcerning the duty to assist, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), VA treatment records, private medical records, and Social Security Administration  (SSA) records have been associated with the claims file.  See 38 U.S.C.A \ufffd 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c) (2015).  He has not identified any other records or evidence he wished to submit or have VA obtain. \r\n\r\nHere, a VA examination was not performed and a medical opinion was not provided.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.159(c)(4), 3.326(a) (2015); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).  VA's duty to provide an examination or opinion is required when the following elements are satisfied: (1) evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence establishing an \"in-service event, injury or disease,\" or a disease manifested in accordance with presumptive service connection regulations occurred which would support incurrence or aggravation, (3) an indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service event, and (4) insufficient evidence to decide the case.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4) (2015); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not asserted that his right shoulder disorder is related to his active service.  Rather, he maintains that it was caused by June 2009 heart surgery at a VA hospital (a claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1151 was referred to the RO in the Introduction above).  The service treatment records are negative for any complaints or findings pertaining to the right shoulder, and a right shoulder disorder was not diagnosed until many years after service in 2009.  Accordingly, because there is no evidence establishing an \"in-service event, injury or disease\" and no indication that the current right shoulder disability may be related to any in-service event, a VA examination and/or opinion is not warranted.  See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83 (holding, in pertinent part, that to trigger VA's duty to provide an examination or opinion, there must be an indication that the current disability may be related to the in-service disease, injury, or event). \r\n\r\nIn light of the above, the Veteran has had a meaningful opportunity to participate effectively in the processing of this claim, and no prejudicial error has been committed in discharging VA's duties to notify and assist.  See Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 407, 410 (2009); Conway v. Principi, 353 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Arneson v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 379, 389 (2011); Vogan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 159, 163 (2010).\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection means that a Veteran has a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2015).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence shows that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d) (2015).  Entitlement to service connection on a direct basis is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or \"medical nexus\" between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2015); see also Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). \r\n\r\nThere is also a presumption of service connection for the chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a).  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b) (2015); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding that \ufffd 3.303(b) only applies to the chronic diseases listed \ufffd 3.309(a)).  Under the presumption, if the chronic disease manifested in service, then service connection will be established for subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any date after service, no matter how remote, without having to show a causal relationship or medical nexus, unless the later manifestations are clearly due to causes unrelated to service (\"intercurrent causes\").  Id.; Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, where a Veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, there is a presumption of service connection for arthritis if the disease manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service, even if there is no evidence of the disease during the service period itself.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309(a) (2015).  This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.307(d)(2015). \r\n\r\nThe Board has an obligation to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases supporting its decision.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7104(d)(1) (West 2014); see also Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Allday v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 517, 527 (1995).  The Board must assess the credibility and weight of the evidence, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995).  A claimant is entitled to the benefit- of-the-doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2015) (providing, in pertinent part, that reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant).  When the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, the claim will be granted.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990); see also Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 532 (2014).  If the preponderance of the evidence weighs against the  claim, it must be denied.  Id.; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, the Board finds that service connection for a right shoulder disorder is not established.\r\n\r\nA December 3, 2009 VA treatment record from the Columbus, Ohio VA Medical Center shows the Veteran first reporting of symptoms (pain) involving his right shoulder.  The record shows that the Veteran reported experiencing right shoulder pain for the past month and that it started after his (June 2009) open heart surgery at the Cleveland, Ohio VA Medical Center.  The December 2009 record also showed that the Veteran denied any injury in the past to his right shoulder.  Upon examination, the VA examiner noted that there was no remarkable bone, joint, or soft tissue abnormality of the right shoulder.  A December 16, 2009 VA treatment record showed that upon examination, the VA examiner noted that she suspected a right rotator cuff pathology (tendinopathy vs. partial tear).\r\n\r\nA January 2010 VA treatment record shows that the Veteran was assessed with right shoulder impingement syndrome.  A June 2010 VA treatment record shows the results of the Veteran's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the right shoulder.  The VA examiner noted his impression of an abnormality in the subscapularis tendon, which may be related to tendinosis and/or partial tear.  The VA examiner also noted bone marrow edema in the humeral head and opined that focal contusion and occult fracture are possibilities.  He also noted mild impingement on the supraspinatus muscle, secondary to AC joint arthropathy.\r\n\r\nA September 2010 VA treatment record noted the VA examiner's impression as adhesive capsulitis, right shoulder.  A January 2011 VA treatment record noted the VA examiner's impression as frozen shoulder.  Thus, based on the Veteran's VA treatment records, the Board finds that the first element for establishing service connection (current disability) on a direct basis, is satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2015); see also Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.\r\n\r\nNow, turning to the second element for establishing service connection (in service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury), the Veteran's service treatment records do not show any complaints, diagnosis, nor treatment for a right shoulder condition.  During his May 1969 entrance examination, the Veteran reported that he had no painful or trick shoulder or elbow.  On his Veteran's August 2009 SSA application, the Veteran does not list any right shoulder condition or symptoms.  As stated above, the Veteran's first reporting of right shoulder symptoms was his December 2009 VA treatment record.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Veteran has not reported an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a right shoulder disease or injury.  Conversely, he has reported that his right shoulder condition was caused or aggravated by his open heart surgery in June 2009, some 39 years following his active service.  Thus, the Board finds the second element for establishing service connection on a direct basis is not satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2015); see also Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the second element for establishing service connection on a direct basis is not satisfied, the third element (medical nexus between current disability and in service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury) is moot.  In any event, the Veteran has not asserted that his current right shoulder disorder had its onset during service or that it is related to any incident of service and there is no competent medical evidence of record showing any such relationship.  Thus, the Board finds the third element for establishing service connection on a direct basis is not satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(a) (2015); see also Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Veteran's right shoulder arthritis, i.e., arthropathy, did not manifest until December 2009.  Thus, since there is no indication of arthritis of the right shoulder within one year from the date of his separation from service in 1970, service connection on this presumptive basis is not established.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309(a) (2015).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim. Consequently, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and service connection for a right shoulder disorder is denied.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107(West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102 (2015); Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 55.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nP.M.

Van Wambeke, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had honorable active duty service from February 1986 to February 1994.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2007 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran presented testimony at a personal hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in March 2010.  A transcript is of record.  The claim was remanded by the Board in May 2010 and subsequently denied by the Board in  a September 2014 decision.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran appealed the Board's September 2014 decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an October 2015 Memorandum Decision, the Court vacated that portion of the Board's September 2014 decision that denied the claim for service connection for a right shoulder disorder.  The Board subsequently remanded the claim in March 2016 for additional development.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted additional evidence directly to the Board after the issuance of a May 2016 supplemental statement of the case.  The evidence was accompanied by a waiver of RO consideration and will therefore be considered in this decision.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1304 (2015). \r\n\r\nThe current record before the Board consists entirely of electronic files known as Virtual VA and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nArthritis of the right shoulder was not shown in service or for many years thereafter, and the most probative evidence indicates the Veteran's current right shoulder disabilities are not related to service.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe requirements for establishing service connection for right shoulder disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1112, 1131, 1137, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nVeterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nUnder the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) VA has a duty to notify and assist a claimant in the development of a claim.  VA's duty to notify was satisfied by a letter in August 2006.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5102, 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2015); see also Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Board finds that the duty to assist a claimant has been satisfied.  The Veteran's service treatment records are on file, as are various post-service medical records.  VA examinations have been conducted and an opinion obtained.  The Veteran was afforded a hearing before the Board and a copy of the transcript is of record.  There is no allegation that the hearing provided to the Veteran was deficient in any way and further discussion of the adequacy of the hearing is not necessary.  Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that actions requested in the prior remands have been undertaken.  More specifically, the Veteran's service treatment and service personnel records were obtained; updated VA treatment records were obtained;    the Veteran was asked to provide the names and addresses of all medical care providers who had treated his right shoulder; and VA examinations were conducted.  Accordingly, the Board finds that there has been substantial compliance with the prior remand instructions and no further action is necessary.  See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97 (2008) (holding that only substantial, and not strict, compliance with the terms of a Board remand is required pursuant to Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998)).  The Board notes that the Veteran did not respond to the March 2016 letter that asked him to provide the names and addresses of all medical care providers who had treated his right shoulder.  \"The duty to assist is not always \r\na one-way street.  If a veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining the putative evidence.\"  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).\r\n\r\nAfter a careful review of the file, the Board finds that all necessary development has been accomplished, and therefore appellate review may proceed without prejudice to the Veteran.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993).  \r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease          or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a chronic condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2013) (holding that only conditions listed as chronic diseases in 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(a) may be considered for service connection under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(b)).  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nGenerally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, and arthritis becomes manifest to a degree of 10 percent within one year from date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.307, 3.309 (2015).  \r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed all the evidence in the record.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that the evidence submitted by the appellant or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate each claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to each claim.      See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake      v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.  VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.  Where there is   an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a right shoulder disorder because the claimed disorder began in service.  \r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran has been diagnosed during the course of the appeal with several right shoulder disorders.  Accordingly, the first criterion for establishing service connection has been met.  The question becomes whether a right shoulder disability is related to service.\r\n\r\nService treatment records show that in August 1988, the Veteran had an x-ray \r\nof his right shoulder due to a dislocation with pain on motion.  No radiographic abnormalities were present.  See radiologic consultation request/report.  There are no additional records indicating that the Veteran sought treatment related to his right shoulder after August 1988, though he was seen with complaints involving  the left shoulder in November 1988 after playing football.  \r\n\r\nThe first treatment for a right shoulder disorder following service was in July 2006, when a VA clinical treatment note documented that the Veteran related a past medical history of chronic bilateral shoulder pain; the impression at that time was chronic shoulder pain.  \r\n\r\nPrivate records related to treatment for a left shoulder condition in conjunction with a claim for Workers Compensation noted in November 2004 that the Veteran's employment as a mail package delivery driver required repetitive overhead lifting of 70 pounds.  In other records from the same facility, the Veteran was encouraged to continue working out at Golds Gym in April 2005 and April 2006.  See records from Suncoast Orthopedics.  \r\n\r\nAs there is no competent evidence of right shoulder arthritis in service or within     one year following the Veteran's February 1994 discharge from service, competent evidence linking the current right shoulder condition with service is required to establish service connection.  On the question of a nexus between the claimed right shoulder disorder and service, there is evidence both for and against the claim.  \r\n\r\nIn September 2008, a private orthopedic surgeon evaluated the Veteran for multiple chronic disabilities that reportedly began in the military.  The Veteran related bilateral shoulder dislocation that both occurred around 1988 while playing football in service.  In regards to his right shoulder, the Veteran reported an in-service right shoulder dislocation with non-operative treatment that he did not report, but which caused continued pain until his separation from service.  The Veteran asserted that his right shoulder continued to bother him and that he never had any full-fledged further dislocations, but felt he had multiple subluxations that were all self-reduced.  Following examination, the orthopedic surgeon provided an impression of multiple injuries sustained during military service with persistent problems, including right shoulder instability and impingement.  See record from Center for Orthopedic Injuries & Disorders.  The orthopedic surgeon did not provide a rationale for the determination that the right shoulder instability and impingement represented persistent problems since an in-service injury; therefore it is not afforded any probative value.  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision as to what weight to assign the opinion).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA orthopedic examination in November 2010.  He reported the onset of right shoulder symptoms following an injury incurred in    1987 during service, which caused his right shoulder to pop out of the socket.  Reportedly, the condition had remained symptomatic since that time and was progressively worsening.  Following an examination of the Veteran, to include range of motion findings and radiographic studies, the examiner diagnosed right rotator cuff tendinitis with partial thickness tear.  In its October 2015 Memorandum Decision, the Court determined that the November 2010 VA examination and corresponding opinion were inadequate; as such, the opinion rendered will not be discussed.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was seen privately for right shoulder pain in January 2013.  He reported a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder while serving in the Gulf War, which was treated conservatively.  He reported pain and apprehension in the right shoulder.  The diagnoses were right shoulder impingement syndrome and right shoulder apprehension with a probable torn glenoid labrum.  A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recommended.  See record from Suncoast Orthopedics.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent an MRI at Clearwater Imaging the following month.  The findings were compared to a December 2011 MRI.  The impression was mild to moderate tendinosis again seen throughout the supraspinatus tendon without focal tear; no labral tear seen but small joint effusion was noted and an arthrogram may be helpful if pain persists; and mild arthrosis in the acromioclavicular joint with minimal, if any, impingement (no change).  \r\n\r\nA February 2013 private treatment record documents that the Veteran was seen for recheck of the right shoulder.  The findings of the February 2013 MRI report were noted.  The February 2013 examiner provided diagnoses of torn glenoid labrum, right shoulder; and history of recurrent dislocation since the original one in the military in 1988.  In an addendum, it was noted that arthroscopy of the right shoulder was recommended because the Veteran had a torn labrum.  See records from Suncoast Orthopedics.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA shoulder Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) examination in April 2016, at which time his electronic claims files and VA treatment records were reviewed.  The claimed conditions that pertained to the DBQ were noted to include dislocation, instability, impingement, and rotator cuff tendinopathy with focal partial thickness tears of the right supraspinatus.  The diagnoses provided were right shoulder impingement syndrome; right rotator cuff tendonitis; and right glenohumeral joint dislocation.  The Veteran stated that he fell off a truck and dislocated the right shoulder in 1988.  He indicated that it continued to dislocate    with certain movements but he was able to place it back himself.  He separated from the military in 1994.  The Veteran reported that it continued to dislocate and he would put it back in place himself.  He worked for UPS for 20 years from 1994 through 2015.  He denied any additional injury to his right shoulder post separation and  denied any treatment.  The Veteran reported that he had difficulty raising his arm   and problems when he wakes up with moving.  He stated he had constant pain in the shoulder.  \r\n\r\nThe April 2016 VA examiner provided an opinion that the Veteran's right shoulder condition is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the dislocation during service.  The rationale in support of the opinion noted that service treatment records showed complaint of right shoulder dislocation on August 4, 1988, which he put back in place himself, and that there was no other evidence in the service treatment records showing treatment for his right shoulder during service.  The examiner noted an entry from 1993 with complaint of foot pain while playing basketball, and the examiner noted it was not likely that the Veteran could play basketball with a chronic right shoulder condition (dislocation, instability, impingement or rotator cuff condition) as basketball requires overhead use of the arms.  The examiner also noted that after separation from service, the Veteran worked for UPS with duties that included heavy (70 pounds) overhead lifting.  The examiner indicated that it would be unlikely that he could perform these duties with a chronic right shoulder condition (dislocation, instability, impingement or rotator cuff condition).  The examiner also noted that the Veteran's current right shoulder condition (instability, impingement and rotator cuff condition) most likely is a result of his post separation employment with repetitive lifting and not to a single dislocation from 1988.  This opinion, which is supported by detailed rationale that takes into consideration the Veteran's specific in-service and post-service medical history and records, to include his complaints of continual right shoulder symptoms in service and after discharge, is afforded high probative value.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000) (a factor for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion includes the thoroughness and detail of the opinion).\r\n\r\nThe 2013 private treatment records from Suncoast Orthopedics and the 2013 MRI conducted at Clearwater Imaging were attached to a May 2016 letter from Dr. S.R.W.  Dr. W. reported that he had examined the Veteran's right shoulder and reviewed the Veteran's medical records.  It was Dr. W.'s medical opinion that the Veteran's current diagnosis of right shoulder impingement, right shoulder instability, and right shoulder tendinitis is more than likely caused by the Veteran's right shoulder dislocation during the Veteran's service in the military.  No rationale was provided for this opinion; therefore it is not afforded any probative value.  Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124.  \r\n\r\nIn a June 2016 letter, Dr. W. reported that the Veteran related \"that he had a dislocation of his shoulder in 1988, which was traumatic.  He has had multiple dislocations since then, and he has never had treatment other than closed reductions.  To dislocate the shoulder, most of the time, the anterior glenoid labrum is also torn.  Sometimes it will heal down on its own.  If it does not and is not repaired, then the patient will continue to suffer dislocations of the shoulder because of the instability caused by the torn glenoid labrum.\"  It is unclear whether this addendum letter was intended to serve as rationale for the May 2016 opinion.  If so, it is afforded no probative value given that Dr. W. does not state that what was described is what happened in the Veteran's case; rather, Dr. W. is providing a blanket statement regarding what happens in most shoulder dislocations.  Id.  Moreover, as will be discussed below, the assertion of repeated dislocations since 1988 is not consistent with other evidence of record, and reliance on that assertion reduces the probative value of the medical opinion.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that \"an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value\").\r\n\r\nThe Board has considered the Veteran's reports of continual right shoulder symptoms and dislocations following the 1988 injury, but finds such assertions are not persuasive.  The Board has come to this conclusion based on the fact that the Veteran was seen multiple times in service for other orthopedic conditions after    his August 1988 right shoulder dislocation, but never mentioned right shoulder problems at those times, to include when seeking treatment in November 1988 for left shoulder problems.  In that vein, while the Board acknowledges the Veteran's March 2010 testimony that he did not want to go to sick call frequently, it would seem likely that if he was presenting to sick call for other orthopedic concerns, he would have taken the opportunity to mention significant continuing problems with his right shoulder.  See AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (recognizing the widely held view that the absence of an entry in a record may be considered evidence that the fact did not occur if it appears that the fact would have been recorded if present).  Moreover, the Board notes the Veteran was seen on multiple occasions for minor complaints such as head colds, suggesting he was not avoiding sick call except for serious illness and injuries.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes additionally that he injured his left shoulder playing football a     few months after the right shoulder injury and a 1992 service treatment record    noted the Veteran's report of lower extremity pain after playing a basketball game, which suggests the Veteran's right shoulder did not prevent such activities, as    might be expected had the Veteran suffered from continued right shoulder problems.  Moreover, following service, the Veteran worked in a capacity requiring repetitive overhead lifting of 70 pounds as a mail package delivery driver and during treatment in 2004 and 2005 following a work-related injury to the left shoulder, no complaints were noted with respect to the right shoulder.  Additionally, the Veteran has reported to the 2016 examiner that a fall from a truck caused the right shoulder dislocation, while he reported to a private physician in 2008 that the dislocation occurred playing \r\nfootball.  In January 2013, he advised a treatment provider that he suffered a traumatic dislocation while serving in the Gulf War; however, his injury occurred in 1988, prior to the start of the war.  Further, the Veteran reported to the physician in September 2008 that he never had any further full-fledged dislocations, but had subluxations.  The Veteran now reports he has suffered repeated dislocations, and such assertion was repeated by Dr. W. in the June 2016 letter.  In sum, the Board finds the Veteran's assertions as to continuing symptoms and dislocations since the initial injury are not persuasive.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-1337 (2006) (the lack of contemporaneous medical records, the significant time delay between the affiants' observations and the date on which the statements were written, and conflicting statements of the veteran are factors that the Board can consider and weigh against a veteran's lay evidence).\r\n\r\nWhile the Veteran believes that his current right shoulder disorder is related to service, as a lay person, the Veteran has not shown that he has specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).  In this regard, the diagnosis and etiology of a right shoulder disability are matters not capable of lay observation, and require medical expertise to determine.  Moreover, whether the symptoms the Veteran experienced in service or following service are in any way related to his current disability is also a matter that also requires medical expertise to determine.  See Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 301 (1999) (\"Although the veteran is competent to testify to the pain he has experienced since his tour in the Persian Gulf, he is not competent to testify to the fact that what he experienced in service and since service is the same condition he is currently diagnosed with.\").  Thus, the Veteran's own opinion regarding the etiology of his current right shoulder disorders is not competent medical evidence.  The Board finds the opinion of the April 2016 VA examiner, which, for the reasons discussed above, is the most probative medical opinion of record in this case, to be significantly more probative than the Veteran's lay assertions.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Board finds the preponderance of the competent, credible, and probative evidence is against the claim for service connection for a right shoulder disability, and the appeal is denied.  \r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet.

The veteran also had periods of active duty \r\nfor training (ACDUTRA) and inactive duty with the Army \r\nReserves.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a January 2004 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nHouston, Texas.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe VCAA and its implementing regulations provide that VA \r\nwill assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to \r\nsubstantiate a claim.  Under these provisions, VA is required \r\nto obtain service medical records and relevant VA healthcare \r\nrecords and must make reasonable efforts to help the veteran \r\nobtain other relevant medical records.  The duty to assist \r\nalso requires VA to provide the claimant with a medical \r\nexamination or a medical opinion when such an examination or \r\nopinion is necessary to make a decision on a claim.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(d) (West 2002);  38 C.F.R \ufffd 3.159 (2007).  \r\nThe Court has mandated that VA ensure strict compliance with \r\nthe provisions of the VCAA.  Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. \r\nApp. at 183 (2002).\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if it is shown that a \r\nveteran has a disability resulting from an injury or disease \r\ncontracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a \r\npreexisting injury or disease contracted in the line of duty \r\nin the active military, naval or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n1110; 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303.  Active military service includes \r\nactive duty, any period of active duty for training \r\n(\"ACDUTRA\") during which the individual concerned was \r\ndisabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or \r\naggravated in the line of duty, and any period of inactive \r\nduty training (\"INACDUTRA\") during which the individual \r\nconcerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or \r\naggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial \r\ninfarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident \r\nwhich occurred during such training.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.6(a) \r\n(2007).  Active duty for training means full-time duty in the \r\nArmed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes.  38 \r\nC.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.6(c) (2007).\r\n\r\nOnly service department records can establish if and when a \r\nperson was serving on active duty, active duty for training \r\nor inactive duty training.  Cahall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 232, \r\n237 (1994).\r\n\r\nThe veteran maintains that diabetes mellitus was initially \r\ndiagnosed during his service in the Army Reserves.  In the \r\nAugust 2004 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the veteran stated \r\nhe was originally diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, \" while \r\nserving in the active Army Reserves and during a drill period \r\nwith the 302nd Engineer Battalion in Corpus Christi, Texas.\"    \r\n\r\nA review of the claims file indicates that personnel records \r\nfrom the veteran's reserve service are outstanding.  In \r\naddition, it appears that some of the reserve medical records \r\nhave not been obtained.  The reserve service medical records \r\nin evidence are limited to reports of annual examinations.  \r\nThe reserve medical records and personnel records are \r\nnecessary in order to determine whether diabetes was \r\ndiagnosed during a period of ACDUTRA.  \r\n\r\nThe record reflects that a diagnosis of \"glucose \r\nintolerance, possible diabetes\" was noted during a July 1986 \r\nquadrennial examination.  Service medical records also \r\ncontain a letter from a private physician, dated in January \r\n1987, in which a diagnosis of adult onset diabetes was noted.  \r\nHowever, it is not clear whether diabetes mellitus was \r\ndocumented during periods of active duty for training \r\n(ACDUTRA) or inactive duty training (INACDUTRA).  On remand, \r\nreasonable efforts should be made to obtain the veteran's \r\nreserve personnel records and reserve service medical \r\nrecords.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the veteran had ACDUTRA for any of the dates \r\nwhere an elevated glucose level or diabetes mellitus were \r\nnoted, the claim should be referred for a VA medical \r\nexamination and an etiology opinion as to whether diabetes \r\nmellitus had its onset or was aggravated during ACDUTRA or \r\nactive service.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Attempt to obtain the veteran's \r\nreserve service medical and reserve \r\nservice personnel records from the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center (NPRC).  \r\nThe veteran and his representative should \r\nbe informed of the status of all records \r\nrequests.  The NPRC should be requested to \r\nverify all periods of ACDUTRA and \r\nINACDUTRA.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO should also request the veteran \r\nto submit a copy of all Army Reserve \r\nrecords in his possession that document \r\nprecise periods of active duty and active \r\nduty for training, such as copies of \r\norders, military pay statements, etc.\r\n\r\n3.  The veteran should be requested to \r\nprovide the names of any physicians or \r\ntreating facilities which were involved in \r\nthe initial diagnosis of his diabetes in \r\n1986 or 1987.  All identified records \r\nshould be obtained.  \r\n\r\n4.  If  the evidence establishes that the \r\nveteran had ACDUTRA or active duty when \r\nhis glucose was elevated or his diabetes \r\nmellitus was diagnosed, then the RO should \r\nschedule the veteran for a VA examination \r\nwith an appropriate physician.  The \r\nexaminer should be provided with a list of \r\nthe verified periods of ACDUTRA.  The \r\nphysician should be provided a copy of the \r\nclaims file prior to the examination and \r\nshould indicate in the examination report \r\nthat a review of the claims file was \r\nconducted.  All necessary tests should be \r\nconducted.  The physician should provide \r\nan opinion as to whether it is at least as \r\nlikely as not (50 percent or greater \r\nlikelihood) that diabetes mellitus had its \r\nonset or increased in severity beyond any \r\nnatural progress during a period of \r\nACDUTRA or active service.  \r\n\r\n5.   Following the completion of the \r\nactions requested above, the claim should \r\nbe readjudicated.  If the benefit sought \r\non appeal remains denied, the veteran and \r\nhis representative should be provided a \r\nSupplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) \r\nand afforded an opportunity to respond.  \r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to \r\nthe Board, if in order.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2007).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nV.

VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that there is a further VA duty to assist the \r\nveteran in developing evidence pertinent to his claim.  38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 \r\n(2007).\r\n\r\nThe veteran contends that his current PTSD is the result of \r\nan attack on his unit, the 124th Transportation Company, \r\nwhile stationed at the Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Vietnam.  In \r\na July 2005 statement, a former United States Air Force \r\nservice member stated that he was in close contact with the \r\nveteran and often observed him on duty as a Gate Guard in Tan \r\nSon Nhut Air Base where the veteran was assigned.  He also \r\nreported that Tan Son Nhut Air Base was attacked on April 13, \r\n1966.  Service records verify that Tan Son Nhut Air Base was \r\nattacked on April 13, 1966.  \r\n\r\nService personnel records indicate the 124th Transportation \r\nCompany was based in Saigon, Vietnam from January 1966 to \r\nJune 1967.  to the contrary, other service records in the \r\nfile indicate that the 124th Transportation Company was \r\nlocated at Cat Lo Navy Base from November 29, 1965 to March \r\n15, 1971.  Seeing that there is a discrepancy in the service \r\nrecords as to the veteran's service in Vietnam, the RO/AMC \r\nshould attempt to confirm where and when the 124th \r\nTransportation Company was stationed in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIn an April 2005 private medical report, the veteran stated \r\nhe was hospitalized for 5 days in the psychiatric ward in \r\n1980 at the VA medical facility in Durham, North Carolina.  A \r\nrequest for this information was made in May 2005, however, \r\nit is unclear whether a response was received.  Therefore the \r\nRO/AMC should attempt to retrieve these records.\r\n\r\nOngoing medical records should also be obtained.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103A(c) (West 2002); see also Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. \r\nApp. 611 (1992) (VA medical records are in constructive \r\npossession of the agency, and must be obtained if the \r\nmaterial could be determinative of the claim).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Ask the veteran to provide the names \r\nand addresses of all medical care \r\nproviders, VA and non-VA, from whom he has \r\nreceived treatment for PTSD since April \r\n2005.  After securing any necessary \r\nrelease, copies of such records should be \r\nrequested, including any treatment records \r\nfrom 1980 at the VA Durham, North Carolina \r\nhealthcare system.\r\n\r\n2.  The veteran should be asked to provide \r\nadditional lay or wriiten evidence to \r\ncorroborate his account of being present at \r\nthe time of an enemy attack on Tan Son Nhut \r\nAir Force base in April 1966.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO/AMC should another attempt to \r\nverify the location where the 124th \r\nTransportation Company was based in \r\nVietnam from September 1965 to September \r\n1966.  \r\n\r\n4.  If an in-service stressor is verified, \r\nthe RO/AMC should then schedule the \r\nveteran for a VA psychiatric examination \r\nto determine the current nature of the \r\nveteran's PTSD.  The claims folder must be \r\nmade available to and reviewed by the \r\nexaminer in connection with the \r\nexamination.  All tests deemed necessary \r\nshould be conducted.  The examiner should \r\nprovide a diagnosis for any psychiatric \r\ndisorders found.  \r\n\r\nFollowing review of the claims file and \r\nexamination of the veteran, the examiner \r\nshould provide an opinion as to whether it \r\nis more likely, less likely, or at least \r\nas likely as not that a current \r\npsychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is \r\nrelated to any incident of the veteran's \r\nactive duty service.  A rationale for the \r\nopinion should be provided.\r\n\r\n5.  After the development requested above \r\nhas been completed to the extent possible, \r\nthe record should again be reviewed.  If \r\nthe benefit sought on appeal remains \r\ndenied, the appellant and representative, \r\nif any, should be furnished a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case, and given the \r\nopportunity to respond thereto.

Schechner, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from October 1946 to March \r\n1948.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a December 2004 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. \r\nPetersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nIn July 2006, the Board issued a decision on this claim.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) issued a decision to remand this case \r\nto the Board for further development and readjudication, \r\npursuant to a Joint Motion by the parties for an order to \r\nvacate and remand the July 2006 Board decision.\r\n\r\nThis matter was advanced on the docket after good or \r\nsufficient cause was shown to do so.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107; \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC, to comply with the Court's \r\nremand.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is \r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the Joint Motion to the court, the VA and the appellant \r\nagreed that a remand was necessary in this case because the \r\nBoard did not ensure compliance with VA's duty to assist by \r\nproviding an adequate medical opinion.  The VA has a duty to \r\nassist claimants, to include \"providing a medical \r\nexamination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an \r\nexamination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the \r\nclaim.\"  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(d); see also 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.159(c)(4).\r\n\r\nThe veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2004, \r\nwhich both the VA General Counsel and the veteran agree is \r\nnot adequate, because the examiner based his awkwardly worded \r\nmedical opinion on an inaccurate factual premise.  The basis \r\nof this finding is very unclear.  However, pursuant to the \r\nCourt's remand, the veteran must be given a new VA medical \r\nexamination and opinion.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. The veteran should be afforded another \r\nVA medical examination, wherein the \r\nmedical examiner has the opportunity to \r\nreview the entire claims file, including \r\nthe veteran's testimony during the \r\nSeptember 2005 RO formal hearing and the \r\nFebruary 2008 joint motion from the Court.  \r\n\r\n2.  The examiner should offer a medical \r\nopinion regarding whether the veteran's \r\ncurrent cervical spine disability was \r\nincurred in his military service from \r\nOctober 1946 to March 1948.  The examiner \r\nshould state whether the cervical spine \r\ndisability is more likely than not, as \r\nlikely as not, or less likely than not \r\nrelated to service, including any spinal \r\ninjuries noted in service, and explain the \r\nreasoning behind the opinion.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO should then readjudicate the \r\nclaim.  If the benefit sought on appeal is \r\nnot granted to the veteran's satisfaction, \r\nthe veteran must be provided with an SSOC, \r\nwhich addresses all of the evidence \r\nreceived since the September 2005 SOC was \r\nissued.  An appropriate period of time \r\nshould then be allowed for a response, \r\nbefore the record is returned to the Board \r\nfor further review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.

DeFrank, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from September 1979 to \r\nSeptember 1982.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a January 2005 rating decision of the \r\nAtlanta, Georgia Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA), which denied entitlement to service \r\nconnection for a back condition.\r\n\r\nIn March 2008, the veteran attended a hearing at the RO \r\nbefore the undersigned. The transcript of the hearing is \r\nassociated with the claims file.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAt his January 2005 hearing, the veteran testified that he \r\nhad applied for Social Security Disability benefits and \r\nunderwent an examination in January 2008 in conjunction with \r\nhis application.\r\n\r\nAn actual decision by the Social Security Administration \r\n(SSA), and the medical records on which that decision was \r\nbased, are not of record.  These records are potentially \r\npertinent to the claims on appeal.  VA is required to obtain \r\nthe SSA records prior to deciding the veteran's claim.  \r\nMurincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363 (1992)); Masors v. \r\nDerwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181, 188 (1992). \r\n\r\nAt his January 2008 hearing, the veteran also reported that \r\nhe had undergone back surgery at a Medical Center in \r\nChatsworth, Georgia.  VA has a duty to obtain relevant \r\nrecords of treatment reported by private physicians.  Massey \r\nv. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204 (1994).  Records of this treatment \r\nat the Medical Center in Chatsworth, Georgia have not been \r\nassociated with the claims file, and may be pertinent to the \r\nclaim on appeal.  Thus, attempts should be made to associate \r\nwith the claims file treatment reports from this facility. \r\n\r\nUnder the VCAA, VA is obliged to provide an examination when \r\nthe record contains competent evidence that the claimant has \r\na current disability or signs and symptoms of a current \r\ndisability, the record indicates that the disability or signs \r\nand symptoms of disability may be associated with active \r\nservice; and the record does not contain sufficient \r\ninformation to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103A(d) (West 2002); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. \r\n79 (2006).  The evidence of a link between current disability \r\nand service must be competent.  Wells v. Principi, 326 F.3d \r\n1381 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  \r\n\r\nThe threshold for finding a link between current disability \r\nand service is low.  Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 \r\n(2006); McLendon v. Nicholson, at 83.\r\n\r\nMedical records and the veteran's report of current symptoms \r\nprovide competent evidence of a current low back condition.  \r\nService medical records demonstrate that the veteran was also \r\ntreated for back pain on multiple occasions.  He testified \r\nthat he had experienced ongoing back symptoms since service.  \r\nThe veteran is competent to report in-service symptoms and \r\nhis statements can be read as reporting a continuity of \r\nsymptomatology.  A veteran's report of a continuity of \r\nsymptomatology can serve to trigger VA's duty to provide an \r\nexamination.  Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet App 512 (2004); \r\nCharles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002).  An \r\nexamination is needed so that a medical professional can \r\nreview the record and provide a competent opinion as to \r\nwhether a current back condition is related to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Contact the Social Security \r\nAdministration and obtain the veteran's \r\ncomplete Social Security records, \r\nincluding all decisions and any medical \r\nrecords relied upon in making those \r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n2.  The agency of original jurisdiction \r\n(AOJ) should take all necessary steps to \r\nobtain any records of treatment pertinent \r\nto the claims on appeal from the Medical \r\nCenter in Chatsworth, Georgia.\r\n\r\n3.  The AOJ should schedule the veteran \r\nfor a VA examination to determine whether \r\nhe has a current back condition that is \r\nrelated to service.  The examiner should \r\nreview the claims folder and note such \r\nreview in the examination report or in an \r\naddendum.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner should provide an opinion as \r\nto whether the veteran has a current back \r\ncondition and, if so, whether it is at \r\nleast as likely as not (50 percent \r\nprobability or more) that the back \r\ncondition began in service or is \r\notherwise the result of a disease or \r\ninjury in service.  The examiner should \r\nprovide a rationale for these opinions.\r\n\r\n4.  Then re-adjudicate the claim.  If the \r\ndetermination remains unfavorable to the \r\nveteran, issue a supplemental statement \r\nof the case before returning the case to \r\nthe Board, if otherwise in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v.

Snyder, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2007).  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from November 1944 to July \r\n1946.\r\n \r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose \r\nfrom a February 2003 decision of the Huntington , West \r\nVirginia , Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) that denied, on a presumptive basis, the \r\nveteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for a \r\nchronic cough, heart disease, impotency, and physical body \r\nweakness due to ionizing radiation.\r\n \r\nThe veteran requested a Travel Board Hearing, which was \r\nscheduled and rescheduled at his request for May 2005.  In \r\nhis April 2005 response to the RO's notice of the rescheduled \r\nhearing date, he withdrew his request for a hearing.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.702 (2007).\r\n \r\nIn June 2005, the Board referred the veteran's claims of \r\nentitlement to service connection for a chronic cough, heart \r\ndisease, impotency, and physical body weakness to the RO for \r\ndevelopment and adjudication on a direct basis, as the RO \r\ninitally only adjudicated the claims on a presumptive basis.  \r\nSee Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-5 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  \r\nIn June 2005, the Board also denied entitlement to service \r\nconnection for a chronic cough, impotency, and physical body \r\nweakness on a presumptive basis, and remanded the claim of \r\nentitlement to service connection for heart disease on a \r\npresumptive basis to the RO, via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington , DC , for additional development \r\nunder the radiation-specific assistance guidelines.  See \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311 (2007).  The AMC/RO conducted additional \r\ndevelopment, continued to deny the heart claim, and returned \r\nthe case to the Board for further appellate review.\r\n \r\nFor the reasons set forth below the appeal is again REMANDED \r\nto the RO via AMC.  VA will notify the appellant if further \r\naction is required.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n \r\nIf a veteran was exposed in service to ionizing radiation \r\nand, after service, developed any cancer within a period \r\nspecified for each by law, then the veteran's claim is \r\nreferred to the Under Secretary for Benefits who must \r\ndetermine, based on the extent of the exposure, whether there \r\nis a reasonable possibility that the disease was incurred in \r\nservice.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311 (2007).  Under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd \r\n1112(c) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(d), if a veteran participated \r\nin service in a radiation-risk activity and subsequently \r\ndevelops a disease listed in the regulation, the disease is \r\npresumed to be due to the radiation-risk activity.\r\n \r\nService personnel records note the veteran's participation in \r\nthe occupation of Nagasaki during the required dates, which \r\nis a recognized radiation-risk activity.  The list of \r\ndiseases specific to radiation-exposed veterans and for which \r\nservice connection may be granted by presumption pursuant to \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1112(c) and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.309(d), however, does \r\nnot include heart disease.\r\n \r\nWhile the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311 do not allow for \r\npresumptive service connection for non-listed disease, it \r\nnonetheless provides special procedures for evidentiary \r\ndevelopment and adjudication of a claim when the veteran \r\neither presents medical evidence of having one of the \r\nspecifically enumerated cancers or when he presents \r\nscientific evidence that a current non-listed disability is \r\nrelated to ionizing radiation exposure.  As noted in the \r\nprior remand, the veteran and his representative have \r\npresented scientific evidence of a link between radiation \r\nexposure and cardiovascular disease.  Thus, the Board \r\nremanded for development under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311 in June \r\n2005.\r\n \r\nThe AMC obtained a medical examination and opinion from a \r\ncardiologist, who opined in August 2006 that the veteran's \r\ncardiovascular disease was most likely secondary to his long \r\nhistory of cigarette smoking.  The examiner also noted that \r\nhe was \"unaware of any medical literature that is currently \r\navailable that would support ionizing radiation as a cause of \r\ncoronary atherosclerosis.\"  Perhaps the examiner's emphasis \r\nwas on \"recently available,\" but the Board cannot be \r\ncertain.  In any event, the evidence which prompted the \r\nremand were studies published in the Journal of the American \r\nMedical Association in December 2003 and the Health Scout \r\nNews.  References to these studies are in the claims folder.  \r\nThe examiner noted his review of the claims file but did not \r\nnote or otherwise refer to those studies.  This omission, \r\nalone, necessitates remand for clarification.  There is, \r\nhowever, another omission which necessitates a remand.\r\n \r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(b)(4), a radiation-exposed veteran's \r\nclaim which meets all criteria except that of manifesting a \r\nradiogenic disease will still be processed in the same manner \r\nas for a radiogenic disease under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(b)(1).  \r\nThe critical component of subsection (b)(1) is referral to \r\nthe Under Secretary For Benefits for consideration under 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(c).  Under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.311(c), the Under \r\nSecretary may request an advisory opinion from the Under \r\nSecretary of Health, who will consider assessment under sound \r\nmedical principles.  The Board notes that AMC/RO obtained a \r\ndose estimate from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency based \r\non the veteran's location and length of exposure while in \r\nNagasaki; so that component of the required development is \r\ncompleted.\r\n \r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n \r\n(This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant \r\nto 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2007).  Expedited handling is \r\nrequired.)\r\n \r\n1.  The AMC/RO shall return the claims \r\nfile to the cardiologist who conducted \r\nthe August 2006 examination for \r\nclarification of his notation and \r\nopinion.  Specifically, when he noted he \r\nwas unaware of any recent medical \r\nliterature that would support ionizing \r\nradiation as a cause of coronary \r\natherosclerosis, did he include or \r\nconsider the studies published in the \r\nDecember 2003 issue of the Journal of the \r\nAmerican Medical Association and the \r\nHealth Scout News in rendering his \r\nopinion of no nexus?  Request the \r\nexaminer express agreement or non-\r\nagreement with the studies and whether \r\nthey change his opinion in any respect.  \r\nAn explanation of any opinion rendered is \r\nrequested.  His clarification may well be \r\nof use to the Under Secretary For \r\nBenefits.  Should the same cardiologist \r\nnot be available, the claims folder \r\nshould be forwarded to another \r\ncardiologist for review, and an opinon \r\naddressing whether it is at least as \r\nlikely as not that the appellant's \r\ninservice exposure to ionizing radiation \r\ncaused his development of coronary artery \r\ndisease.  A complete rationale must \r\naccompany any opinion offered.\r\n \r\n2.  After the development requested has \r\nbeen completed, the AMC/RO should review \r\nthe examination report to ensure that it \r\nis in complete compliance with the \r\ndirectives of this REMAND. If the report \r\nis deficient in any manner, the AMC/RO \r\nmust implement corrective procedures at \r\nonce.\r\n \r\n3.  Upon completion of the above, the \r\nAMC/RO must refer the file to the Under \r\nSecretary For Benefits for appropriate \r\naction and consideration under 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.311(c).\r\n \r\n4.  After the above is complete, \r\nreadjudicate the veteran's claim in light \r\nof the additional evidence obtained.  \r\nIf the claim is not granted to his \r\nsatisfaction, send him and his \r\nrepresentative a Supplemental Statement \r\nof the Case and give them an opportunity \r\nto respond to it before returning the \r\nfile to the Board for further appellate \r\nconsideration.\r\n \r\nThe case should then be returned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration.  The Board intimates no opinion as \r\nto the ultimate outcome of this case.  The veteran need take \r\nno action unless otherwise notified.  VA will notify him if \r\nfurther action is required on his part.  He has the right to \r\nsubmit additional evidence and argument concerning the claims \r\nthe Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v.

Cleary, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from July 1961 to July \r\n1965.\r\n\r\nThis matter has come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from January 2002 rating decision of the \r\nPhoenix, Arizona, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \r\nRegional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nIn April 2008, the Board remanded the claim for further \r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran has submitted the records and opinion of K.H., a \r\nlicensed professional counselor in order to establish a nexus \r\nbetween his current mental disorder and the incidents of poor \r\nconduct described in his personnel records, which he argues \r\nare symptoms of a chronic mental condition with its onset \r\nduring service.  Initially, the Board is unclear on the \r\nmedical qualifications of a licensed professional counselor.  \r\nSee Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137 (1994)(requiring \r\ntrained health care professionals to enter conclusions that \r\nrequire medical expertise, such as opinions as to diagnosis \r\nand causation).  Regardless, this opinion explicitly \r\nacknowledges that it is based on a subjective history given \r\nby the veteran.  The Board notes that medical evaluation that \r\nis merely a recitation of veteran's self-reported and \r\nunsubstantiated history has no probative value.  Sanchez-\r\nBenitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999); Swann v. Brown, 5 \r\nVet. App. 229 (1993); Godfrey v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 113 \r\n(1995); Reonal and LeShore, supra.  However, the Board cannot \r\ndiscount medical opinion solely because it is based on \r\nhistory provided by the veteran without also evaluating the \r\ncredibility and weight of the history upon which the opinion \r\nis predicated.  Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171 \r\n(2005).  The credibility of that underlying history is called \r\ninto question because the opinion derived from them \r\nreferences an inaccurate date of discharge.  Nonetheless, the \r\nveteran has raised the possibility that his negative \r\nperformance evaluations and administrative remarks show \r\nsymptoms of his current mental disorder sufficient to \r\nestablish chronicity.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe RO should schedule the veteran for \r\na VA examination by a physician with \r\nappropriate expertise to determine the \r\nnature and etiology of his mental \r\ndisorder.  All indicated tests and \r\nstudies should be accomplished, and \r\nclinical findings should be reported in \r\ndetail.  The veteran's claims folder \r\nshould be made available to and \r\nreviewed by the examiner.  The examiner \r\nshould provide an opinion as to whether \r\nis it at least as likely as not \r\n(meaning at least 50-percent probable) \r\nthat any diagnosed mental disorder is \r\ndue to or the result of the veteran's \r\nmilitary service.  Additionally, the \r\nexaminer should review the veteran's \r\npersonnel records and provide an \r\nopinion as to whether the behavior \r\ndescribed therein evinces symptoms of \r\nany current mental disorder.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe RO should readjudicate the issue of \r\nentitlement to service connection for a \r\nmental disorder, in light of the \r\nadditional evidence obtained.  If the \r\nbenefit sought is not granted to the \r\nveteran's satisfaction, the veteran and \r\nhis representative should be furnished \r\na supplemental statement of the case \r\nand given an appropriate opportunity to \r\nrespond, before the case is returned to \r\nthe Board.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

T. Werner, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from July 1963 to July \r\n1966.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an April 2005 decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in \r\nSt. Petersburg, Florida.  In August 2007, the veteran and his \r\nwife testified at a hearing before the undersigned at the RO.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran and his representative assert that the claimant \r\nhas PTSD as a result of his service in the Republic of \r\nVietnam.  Specifically, the veteran reported in writings to \r\nVA, statements to his healthcare providers, and/or in \r\ntestimony at his personal hearing that his PTSD was caused, \r\nin substance, by being subject to small arms fire while \r\ndelivering supplies to bases in the Republic of Vietnam while \r\nassigned to the 578th Ordnance Company from October 1965 to \r\nJuly 1966.  He also reported that his PTSD is related to \r\nbeing part of a group of soldiers that had to unload body \r\nbags from a helicopter, possibly at Tan Son Nhut Air Force \r\nBase, while stationed with the 578th Ordnance Company from \r\nOctober 1965 to July 1966.  Finally, he reports that the PTSD \r\nis related to mortar shelling that was incurred while \r\nstationed, at least in part, at Tan Son Nhut Air Force Base.  \r\n\r\nA review of the veteran's service personnel records indicates \r\nthat his occupational specialty was wheel vehicle mechanic, \r\nand that he served in the Republic of Vietnam from October \r\n1965 to July 1966 with the 578th Ordnance Company.  \r\n\r\nWhile no diagnosis of PTSD was made at the time of a November \r\n2006 VA mental health examination, VA treatment records dated \r\nbefore and after this examination, including March 2000 and \r\nApril 2007 VA treatment records, do include diagnoses of \r\nPTSD.  No discussion or mention was made of the previously \r\nmade PTSD diagnosis in the November 2006 examination report.  \r\nIndeed, the Board finds this report to be grossly inadequate \r\nfor adjudication purposes in view of its extreme brevity and \r\nfailure to discuss any of the history of the veteran's mental \r\nhealth treatment as reflected in the medical records already \r\ncontained in the claims file.  Accordingly, on remand, the \r\nveteran must be afforded another VA examination with respect \r\nto his claim for service connection for PTSD.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103A(d) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.326 (2007); Green v. \r\nDerwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121 (1991).  \r\n\r\nWith respect to stressor development, VA Adjudication \r\nProcedure Manual, M21-1 MR, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, \r\nsection H, Topic 29 (December 13, 2005) (formerly VA \r\nAdjudication Procedure Manual (M21-1), Part VI, Ch. \r\n11.37(f)(3)), provides, in relevant part, that in \r\nadjudicating claims of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD, \"[i]f a VA examination . . . establishes a valid \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD, and development is complete in every \r\nrespect but for confirmation of the in-service stressor, \r\nrequest additional evidence from  . . . the Environmental \r\nSupport Group (ESG) [now known as the United Stated Army and \r\nJoint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC)].\"  \r\n\r\nLikewise, the manual provided at that time that in \r\nadjudicating claims of entitlement to service connection for \r\nPTSD, VA must \"always send an inquiry [to the JSRRC] in \r\ninstances in which the only obstacle to service connection is \r\nconfirmation of an alleged stressor.  A denial solely because \r\nof an unconfirmed stressor is improper unless it has first \r\nbeen reviewed by the [JSRRC] . . . .\"  Id. \r\n\r\nTherefore, while a review of the record shows that the RO has \r\nobtained the veteran's service personnel records and the \r\nclaimant has filed with the RO February 1966 to May 1966 Unit \r\nReport for the 578th Ordnance Company, in order to provide \r\nthe claimant with every opportunity to support his claim, a \r\nremand is required to undertake additional development to \r\nverify his stressors and to obtain an adequate mental health \r\nexamination.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(b) (West 2002).  \r\n\r\nWhen readjudicating the claim on remand, consideration will \r\nneed to be afforded to the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) holding in Suozzi v. Brown, \r\n10 Vet. App. 307 (1997), in which it was held that \r\ncorroboration of every detail is not required to satisfy the \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f) requirement that there be credible \r\nsupporting evidence that the claimed stressors actually \r\noccurred.  \r\n\r\nFinally, it is noted that the veteran testified that he has \r\nbeen receiving ongoing treatment for his PTSD at the Tampa VA \r\nMedical Center and/or the Port Richey VA Outreach Clinic \r\nsince approximately 2004 or 2005.  Accordingly, on remand, an \r\neffort will need to be made to obtain all pertinent treatment \r\nrecords from the above facilities.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 5103A(b) (West 2002); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 \r\n(1992).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of \r\nOriginal Jurisdiction (AOJ) for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The AOJ should send another request \r\nto the veteran to obtain as much detail \r\nas possible with respect to his \r\nreported stressors, including dates, \r\nlocations, persons involved, etc.  \r\n\r\n2.  Thereafter, the AOJ should send any \r\nadditional stressor information \r\nprovided by the veteran, as well as the \r\ninformation already of record, \r\nincluding that discussed above, to the \r\nJSRRC for the purpose of verifying the \r\nveteran's alleged in-service stressors, \r\nincluding being subject to small arms \r\nfire, unloading body bags from \r\nhelicopters, and being subject to \r\nmortar shelling.  Copies of the \r\nveteran's DD Form 214, his personnel \r\nrecords, and any other relevant \r\ndocuments should be included with the \r\nrequest.  The JSRRC should be asked to \r\nprovide any information that might \r\ncorroborate the veteran's alleged \r\nstressors.  If the agency is unable to \r\nprovide information regarding any of \r\nthe stressors alleged by the veteran, \r\nit should provide specific confirmation \r\nof that fact.  Any recommended follow-\r\nup action suggested by JSRRC should be \r\naccomplished.  \r\n\r\n3.  The AOJ should obtain records of all \r\nmental health treatment received by the \r\nveteran at the Tampa VA Medical Center \r\nand the Port Richey VA Outreach Clinic, \r\nthat have not already been associated \r\nwith the claims files, from approximately \r\n2004 to the present.  \r\n\r\n4.  Following the completion of the \r\nabove, the veteran should be scheduled \r\nfor a psychiatric examination to \r\ndetermine the presence and etiology of \r\nPTSD.  The claims files must be provided \r\nto the examiner for review.  Any tests or \r\nstudies deemed necessary, if any, should \r\nbe accomplished.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the examiner is requested \r\nto provide an opinion as to whether it is \r\nat least as likely as not, i.e., a 50 \r\npercent or greater degree of probability, \r\nthat the veteran currently has PTSD that \r\nis related to an event, injury, or \r\ndisease incurred during service.  A \r\nrationale should be provided for all \r\nopinions expressed.  \r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, the AOJ should \r\nreadjudicate the veteran's claim taking \r\ninto account, among other things, the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) holding in \r\nSuozzi, supra.  If the benefit sought on \r\nappeal remains denied, the veteran and \r\nhis representative should be provided a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case \r\n(SSOC), and a reasonable period of time \r\nshould be allowed for response. \r\n\r\nAn appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on a matter the Board has remanded.

P. Jones, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from September 1958 to July \r\n1960.  \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from an April 2000 rating decision by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nPittsburg, Pennsylvania.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board issued a decision denying the veteran's claim for \r\nan increased rating for left varicocele in September 2003.  A \r\nSeptember 2004 joint motion vacated the Board's September \r\n2003 decision.  The joint motion faulted the Board's finding \r\nthat referral of the veteran's claim to the Under Secretary \r\nfor Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension \r\nService for consideration of an extraschedular evaluation \r\nunder 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.321(b)(1) (2008) was not warranted.\r\n\r\nIn November 2007, the Board again issued a decision denying \r\nthe veteran's claim for an increased rating for left \r\nvaricocele.  In this decision the Board again found that \r\nreferral of the veteran's claim for an extraschedular \r\nevaluation was not warranted, and provided explanation as to \r\nwhy such referral was not warranted.  However, an April 2008 \r\njoint motion vacated the November 2007 Board decision in part \r\non the Board's finding that referral of the veteran's claim \r\nfor consideration of an extraschedular evaluation under 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.321(b)(1) was not warranted.\r\n\r\nDue to the above history of the veteran's claim, the Board \r\nfinds that a remand is required to permit the appropriate \r\nofficials to consider the veteran's claim on an \r\nextraschedular basis. \r\n\r\nThe veteran should also be advised of the bases for assigning \r\ndisability ratings and effective dates.  See Dingess v. \r\nNicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006) and Vazquez-Flores v. \r\nPeake, 22 Vet. App. 37 (2008).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Send the veteran a corrective notice \r\nletter under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) and 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b), that provides an \r\nexplanation as to the information or \r\nevidence needed to establish disability \r\nratings and effective dates for the claims \r\non appeal, as outlined by the Court in \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. \r\n473 (2006) and Vazquez-Flores v. Peake, 22 \r\nVet. App. 37 (2008).\r\n\r\n2.  The RO shall refer the veteran's claim \r\nfor an increased rating for left \r\nvaricocele to the Director of the \r\nCompensation and Pension Service for \r\nconsideration of the claim on an \r\nextraschedular basis under the provisions \r\nof 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.321(b)(1).\r\n\r\n3.  Upon completion of the above requested \r\ndevelopment reconsider the veteran's \r\nclaim.

T. Hutcheson, Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active service from October 1965 to March \r\n1967.  \r\n\r\nThis matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a May 2008 rating decision of the \r\nIndianapolis, Indiana, Regional Office (RO) which denied \r\nservice connection for chronic hypertension.  In December \r\n2008, the veteran was afforded a videoconference before the \r\nundersigned Veterans Law Judge.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  The Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) will notify the veteran if further action is \r\nrequired on his part.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe veteran asserts that service connection for chronic \r\nhypertension is warranted as he initially manifested the \r\nclaimed disorder during active service.  In reviewing the \r\nveteran's service treatment records, the Board observes that \r\nthe report of his July 1965 physical examination for service \r\nentrance notes that the veteran presented a history of high \r\nblood pressure and \"dizziness or fainting spells.\"  The \r\nveteran was subsequently given a \"three-day blood pressure \r\ncheck.\"  The military examiner commented \"3 day [blood \r\npressure] - acceptable.\"  The veteran was found to be \r\nqualified for active duty.  A September 1965 written \r\nstatement from M. P., M.D., conveys that the veteran had been \r\nseen for hypertension \"which has first been noted \r\napproximately two years ago.\"  The report of a February 1967 \r\nAir Force medical board report notes that the veteran \"had \r\ndocumented hypertension for approximately 3 years with \r\nrecurrent episodes suggesting orthostatic hypotension for \r\napproximately 5 years.\"  He was diagnosed with mild \r\nessential hypertension with orthostatic hypotension which \r\nexisted prior to service entrance and rendered him unfit for \r\ncontinued active service.  \r\n\r\nIn reviewing the report of an April 2008 VA examination for \r\ncompensation purposes, the Board notes that the claims file \r\nwas unavailable for review and the examiner neither noted the \r\nveteran's pre-service treatment for hypertension nor \r\ncommented on whether or not such hypertension increased in \r\nseverity beyond its natural progression during the veteran's \r\nperiod of active service.  The VA's duty to assist includes, \r\nin appropriate cases, the duty to conduct a thorough and \r\ncontemporaneous medical examination which is accurate and \r\nfully descriptive.  Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88, 93 \r\n(1996); Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407-08 (1994); \r\nGreen v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991).  \r\nExaminations for compensation purposes conducted without \r\ncontemporaneous review of the veteran's claims file are \r\ndeficient for rating purposes.  Proscelle v. Derwinski, 2 \r\nVet. App. 629, 632 (1992).  Therefore, the veteran should be \r\nafforded further VA evaluation in order to resolve the issues \r\nraised by the instant appeal.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following action:  \r\n\r\n1.  Review the claims file and ensure \r\nthat all notification and development \r\naction required by the Veterans Claims \r\nAssistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) is \r\ncompleted.  In particular, the RO should \r\nensure that the notification requirements \r\nand development procedures contained in \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R \ufffd\ufffd \r\n3.102, 3.159, 3.326(a) (2008) are fully \r\nmet.  \r\n\r\n2.  Then contact the veteran and request \r\nthat he provide information as to all \r\npost-service treatment of his \r\nhypertension.  Upon receipt of the \r\nrequested information and the appropriate \r\nreleases, contact all identified health \r\ncare providers and request that they \r\nforward copies of all available clinical \r\ndocumentation, not already of record, for \r\nincorporation into the record.  \r\n\r\n3.  Then schedule the veteran for a VA \r\nexamination for compensation purposes in \r\norder to determine the current nature and \r\netiology of the veteran's chronic \r\nhypertension.  All indicated tests and \r\nstudies, should be accomplished and the \r\nfindings then reported in detail.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner should advance an opinion at \r\nto whether it is more likely than not \r\n(i.e., probability greater than 50 \r\npercent); at least as likely as not \r\n(i.e., probability of 50 percent); or \r\nless likely than not (i.e., probability \r\nless than 50 percent) that the veteran's \r\nchronic hypertension existed prior to \r\nservice entrance; had its onset during \r\nactive service; otherwise originated \r\nduring or is causally related to active \r\nservice; or increased in severity beyond \r\nits natural progression during active \r\nservice.  \r\n\r\nSend the claims folder to the examiner \r\nfor review of pertinent documents \r\ntherein. The examination report should \r\nspecifically state that such a review was \r\nconducted.  \r\n\r\n4.  Then readjudicate the veteran's claim \r\nof entitlement to service connection for \r\nchronic hypertension with express \r\nconsideration of the provisions of 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1111, 1137 (West 2002) and 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(b) (2008) and the Federal \r\nCircuit's decision in Wagner v. Principi, \r\n370 F. 3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  If the \r\nbenefit sought on appeal remains denied, \r\nthe veteran should be issued a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC) \r\nwhich addresses all relevant actions \r\ntaken on the veteran's claim for \r\nbenefits, to include a summary of the \r\nevidence and applicable law and \r\nregulations considered, since the \r\nissuance of the statement of the case.  \r\nThe veteran should be given the \r\nopportunity to respond to the SSOC.  \r\n\r\nThe veteran is free to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument while the case is in remand status.  See \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThe veteran's appeal must be afforded expeditious treatment \r\nby the RO.  The law requires that all claims that are \r\nremanded by the Board or by the United States Court of \r\nAppeals for Veterans Claims (Court) for additional \r\ndevelopment or other appropriate action must be handled in an \r\nexpeditious manner.  See The Veterans' Benefits Improvements \r\nAct of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-446, \ufffd 302, 108 Stat. 4645, 4658 \r\n(1994), 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5101 (West 2002) (Historical and \r\nStatutory Notes).  In addition, VBA's Adjudication Procedure \r\nManual, M21-1, Part IV, directs the ROs to provide \r\nexpeditious handling of all cases that have been remanded by \r\nthe Board and the Court.

Thomas Knope, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from April 1969 to April \r\n1973 and from September 2001 to September 2002, with \r\nadditional service in the U.S. Naval Reserves.\r\n\r\nThis matter is on appeal from the New Orleans, Louisiana, \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nThis case was remanded by the Board in September 2007 for \r\nfurther development and is now ready for disposition.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the Veteran stated in October 2007 \r\nthat the RO had not addressed his perforated right tympanic \r\nmembrane.  However, he was service-connected in an October \r\n2004 rating decision for residuals of a right tympanoplasty \r\nwith a noncompensable rating.  If he desires to raise a claim \r\nfor a higher rating, he should do so with specificity at the \r\nRO.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nWhile it regrets that another remand is necessary, the Board \r\nfinds that additional development is required to satisfy VA's \r\nobligations under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 \r\n(VCAA). 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 \r\n(West 2002 & Supp. 2007); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 \r\n(as amended) and 3.326(a) (2008).\r\n\r\nAt his VA examination in December 2008, the examiner noted \r\nthat the Veteran did not undergo an audiogram prior to his \r\nsecond period of active duty in September 2001.  It is clear, \r\nhowever, that he had significant hearing loss at the time his \r\nperforated eardrum was repaired in January 2002.  Without an \r\naudiogram upon reentry into active duty, the examiner could \r\nnot offer an opinion on whether the Veteran's hearing loss \r\nwas related to active duty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the evidence does not currently show the Veteran's \r\nhearing ability upon reentry into active duty service in \r\nSeptember 2001, he submitted a statement from a private \r\nspecialist in December 2003 indicating that he underwent a \r\nfat graft myringoplasty in July 2000.  However, these records \r\nare not associated with the file.  \r\n\r\nAs these records may be probative to the level of the \r\nVeteran's hearing prior to entering active duty in September \r\n2001, an attempt should be made to retrieve these records.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (VA is required to make reasonable \r\nefforts to obtain relevant records, including private \r\nrecords, which the claimant adequately identifies); see also \r\nIvey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1992) (holding that \r\nwhen reference is made to pertinent medical records, VA is on \r\nnotice of their existence and has a duty to assist the \r\nveteran to attempt to obtain them).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  After requesting that the Veteran sign \r\nthe appropriate release, the RO should \r\nattempt to obtain all treatment records \r\nfrom the Veteran's private ear, nose and \r\nthroat specialists that relate to his \r\nmyringoplasty in July 2000.  The RO should \r\nspecifically request any audiograms \r\nperformed as a result of this procedure.  \r\n\r\n2.  If such records are available for \r\nreview, the RO should obtain an opinion \r\nfrom a medical examiner as to whether it \r\nis at least as likely as not (a 50 percent \r\nprobability or higher) that his current \r\nbilateral hearing loss, is related to \r\nservice.  All opinions are to be \r\naccompanied by a clear rationale \r\nconsistent with the evidence of record.\r\n\r\n3.  Upon completion of the above, \r\nreadjudicate the issue on appeal and \r\nconsider all evidence received since \r\nissuance of the last supplement statement \r\nof the case.  If any benefit sought on \r\nappeal remains denied, the Veteran and his \r\nrepresentative should be furnished an \r\nappropriate supplemental statement of the \r\ncase and be provided an opportunity to \r\nrespond.  Thereafter, the case should be \r\nreturned to the Board for further \r\nappellate consideration, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.

Lippman, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nK.A. Kennerly, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran served on active duty from June 1969 to January \r\n1975.  The veteran is a recipient of the Combat Infantryman \r\nBadge and the Purple Heart.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an October 1992 rating decision of the \r\nCleveland, Ohio, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of \r\nVeterans Affairs (VA), which denied the veteran's claim.\r\n\r\nIn a July 1997 decision, the Board affirmed the RO's denial \r\nof the veteran's claim on appeal.  The veteran subsequently \r\nappealed this denial to the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims (Court), and in a Memorandum Decision of \r\nJuly 1999, the Board denial was vacated, with the matter \r\nremanded to the Board for further evidentiary development.\r\n\r\nIn August 2000, with the benefit of the newly obtained \r\nevidence, the Board issued a decision which again affirmed \r\nthe RO's 1992 decision to deny the claim on appeal.  The \r\nmatter was again appealed to the Court.  Upon an unopposed \r\nMotion by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs, the August 2000 Board decision was vacated in March \r\n2001, specifically for consideration of the Veterans Claims \r\nAssistance Act of 2000 (VCAA).  The Board remanded this \r\nmatter to the RO in April 2002.  Later that month, the RO \r\nprovided the veteran and his representative with notice of \r\nthe VCAA and an opportunity to provide the sort of evidence \r\nnecessary for a favorable decision.  In August 2002, the RO \r\nagain denied the benefit sought on appeal, with consideration \r\nof the evidence most recently received.\r\n\r\nBy decision in October 2002, the Board again denied the claim \r\non appeal.  The veteran again appealed this decision to the \r\nCourt.  In an Order dated in April 2004, the Court vacated \r\nthe Board's October 2002 decision and instructed the Board to \r\nremand the veteran's claim for additional VCAA notification.  \r\nIn compliance with that Order, the Board again remands this \r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required on his part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nBased upon the April 2004 Court Order, the Board remands the \r\nveteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for back \r\nstrain, to include as due to service-connected shell fragment \r\nwounds of the left and right lower extremities, for \r\nadditional notification of VA's duties to notify and assist \r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO/AMC should issue the veteran \r\na new VCAA letter that explicitly \r\nrelates to his particular claim.  This \r\nletter should address VA's duties to \r\nnotify and assist the veteran with \r\nregard to direct service connection and \r\nsecondary service connection.  \r\nSpecifically, the letter should: \r\n\r\nNotify the veteran of any information, \r\nand any medical or lay evidence, not \r\npreviously provided to VA that is \r\nnecessary to substantiate the claim.\r\n\r\nAs part of that notice, VA shall \r\nindicate which portion of that \r\ninformation and evidence, if any, is to \r\nbe provided by the veteran and which \r\nportion, if any, VA, in accordance with \r\nsection 5103A will attempt to obtain on \r\nbehalf of the veteran.\r\n\r\nWhen VA receives a complete or \r\nsubstantially complete application for \r\nbenefits, it will notify the veteran of \r\nany information and medical or lay \r\nevidence that is necessary to \r\nsubstantiate the claim.  VA will inform \r\nthe veteran which information and \r\nevidence, if any, he is to provide to VA \r\nand which information and evidence, if \r\nany, VA will attempt to obtain on his \r\nbehalf.\r\n2.  The veteran should also be provided \r\nwith a notice letter providing him with \r\ninformation regarding how VA determines \r\ndisability ratings and effective dates, \r\nconsistent with the holding in \r\nDingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. \r\nApp. 473 (2006).\r\n\r\n3.  After completing the above action and \r\nany other development as may be indicated \r\nby any response received as a consequence \r\nof the actions taken in the paragraphs \r\nabove, the claim should be readjudicated.  \r\nIf the claim remains denied, a \r\nsupplemental statement of the case should \r\nbe provided to the veteran and his \r\nrepresentative.  After they have had an \r\nadequate opportunity to respond, this \r\nissue should be returned to the Board for \r\nfurther appellate review.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nSee Kutscherousky v.

Jones, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1940 to August \r\n1945.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from an August 2004 rating decision of a \r\nRegional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs \r\n(VA), which denied service connection for a low back \r\ndisability.  The Veteran subsequently initiated and perfected \r\nan appeal of this rating determination.  In April 2007, the \r\nVeteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge, \r\nseated at the RO.  \r\n\r\nIn a July 2007 decision and remand order, the Board found \r\nthat while the Veteran's service connection claim for a low \r\nback disability had previously and finally been denied, new \r\nand material evidence had subsequently been submitted \r\nallowing for the claim to be reopened and considered on the \r\nmerits.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5108 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.156 (2008).  The Board then remanded the claim for \r\nadditional development.  It has now been returned to the \r\nBoard.  \r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2007).  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for a low back \r\ndisability, to include as secondary to his service-connected \r\nbilateral pes planus, with metatarsalgia.  38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1112, 1113 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304, \r\n3.307, 3.309, 3.310 (2008).  His claim was reopened and \r\nremanded by the Board in July 2007 in order for additional \r\ndevelopment to be afforded him, including a VA medical \r\nexamination and/or opinion statement.  Among other questions, \r\nthe remand order requested the examiner determine whether the \r\nVeteran's pes planus caused, resulted in, or otherwise \r\naggravated the Veteran's low back disability.  While a VA \r\nmedical examination was afforded the Veteran in September \r\n2008, and an addendum was added to the examination report in \r\nDecember 2008, the examiner failed to address all questions \r\nposed by the Board in the July 2007 remand.  Specifically, \r\nthe remand order requested the examiner determine whether the \r\nservice-connected pes planus proximately caused or resulted \r\nin a low back disability.  If not, the examiner was then to \r\ndetermine whether pes planus aggravated the low back \r\ndisability beyond the natural progress of that disorder.  \r\nHowever, in the September 2008 examination report, no opinion \r\nregarding aggravation is given.  As service connection may be \r\ngranted for a nonservice-connected disability aggravated by a \r\nservice-connected disability, such an opinion is crucial to \r\nthe adjudication of the issue on appeal.  Additionally, the \r\nU.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held the Board \r\nis required to remand an inadequate medical opinion for \r\nfailure to comply with a prior remand order.  Stefl v. \r\nNicholson, 21 Vet. App.  170 (2007).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2007).  Expedited \r\nhandling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  Return the claims file to the VA \r\nmedical doctor who examined the Veteran in \r\nSeptember 2008 to determine whether his \r\npes planus caused or aggravated a low back \r\ncondition.  If that VA physician is \r\nunavailable, then schedule the Veteran to \r\nundergo a comprehensive VA examination to \r\ndetermine whether his pes planus caused or \r\naggravated a low back disorder, or whether \r\nsuch a disorder was incurred during \r\nmilitary service.  The examiner should \r\nrecord all pertinent medical complaints, \r\nsymptoms, and clinical findings.  \r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the relevant medical \r\nevidence in the claims file and any tests \r\nthat are deemed necessary, the VA medical \r\ndoctor or examiner must address the \r\nfollowing questions:\r\n\r\ni) Is it as likely as not the Veteran's \r\nlow back disorder was incurred during \r\nmilitary service or within a year \r\nthereafter, to include as a result of an \r\nin-service motorcycle accident?  \r\n\r\nii) Is it as likely as not that the \r\nVeteran's low back disorder is proximately \r\ndue to or the result of his bilateral pes \r\nplanus with metatarsalgia?\r\n\r\niii) If a low back condition is not found \r\nto be proximately due to or the result of \r\nthe Veteran's bilateral pes planus with \r\nmetatarsalgia, is it as likely as not his \r\nbilateral pes planus with metatarsalgia \r\nresults in an increase of the severity of \r\nany current low back disorder, beyond the \r\nnatural progression of the low back \r\ndisorder (aggravation)?\r\n\r\niv) If aggravation is determined to be \r\npresent, the examiner must address the \r\nfollowing medical issues:\r\n\r\n(a) The baseline manifestations which are \r\ndue to a low back condition; (b) the \r\nincreased manifestations which, in the \r\nexaminer's opinion, are proximately due to \r\nthe Veteran's bilateral pes planus with \r\nmetatarsalgia based on medical \r\nconsiderations; and (c) the medical \r\nconsiderations supporting an opinion that \r\nincreased manifestations of a low back \r\ncondition found on examination are \r\nproximately due to the Veteran's pes \r\nplanus.\r\n\r\nThe clinician is requested to provide a \r\nrationale for any opinion expressed and is \r\nadvised that if a conclusion cannot be \r\nreached without resort to speculation, he \r\nor she should so indicate in the \r\nexamination report and discuss why an \r\nopinion is not possible.\r\n\r\n2.  Upon completion of the examination, \r\ninsure all questions within this remand \r\norder were addressed by the examiner.  \r\nAfter undertaking any additional \r\ndevelopment deemed appropriate, and giving \r\nthe appellant full opportunity to \r\nsupplement the record, adjudicate the \r\nVeteran's pending claim in light of any \r\nadditional evidence added to the record.  \r\nIf any benefit sought on appeal remains \r\ndenied, the Veteran and his representative \r\nshould be furnished with a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case and be afforded the \r\napplicable opportunity to respond before \r\nthe record is returned to the Board for \r\nfurther review.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  \r\nKutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims for additional development or other \r\nappropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  \r\nSee 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2008).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nM.

Milmoe, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army \r\nfrom June 1965 to June 1967, to include service in Vietnam.  \r\nAmong his many awards and decorations for meritorious service \r\nduring that period were the Purple Heart, the Parachutist \r\nBadge, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.  Another prior \r\nperiod of duty was served by the Veteran in the Marine Corps, \r\nalthough there is a conflict in the record as to whether that \r\nservice was active or inactive duty, and such matter is \r\nfurther addressed in the Remand that follows.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals \r\n(Board) on appeal from a rating action entered in September \r\n2005 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional \r\nOffice (RO) in Los Angeles, California, denying the veteran's \r\nclaim for service connection for a back disorder, including \r\nresiduals of in-service back injuries.  This claim has since \r\nbeen certified to the Board by the RO in San Diego, \r\nCalifornia.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the VA's Appeals \r\nManagement Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify \r\nthe appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran offers a credible account of numerous in-service \r\ninjuries to his back, primarily involving impact to the spine \r\nthrough multiple parachute jumps, but also including various \r\nincidents while he was engaged in combat with the enemy.  On \r\nthat basis, the existence of the in-service combat-related \r\ninjuries to the back must be conceded.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 1154(b) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran requests a remand of this appeal for the conduct \r\nof a VA medical examination in order to confirm that he has a \r\ncurrent back disability that is causally linked to verified \r\nin-service trauma.  He points out that a VA examination was \r\nafforded him for his left shoulder in the recent past, but \r\nthat the back was not examined at that time.  \r\n\r\nIn light of the facts and circumstances particular to this \r\ncase, the Board finds the veteran's development request to be \r\na reasonable one, as well as one within the purview of the \r\nBoard's obligation to assist the Veteran in the development \r\nof all pertinent evidence.  To that end, remand to obtain a \r\nVA medical examination and opinion as to the nexus of any \r\nexisting back disorder to service and injuries to the back \r\ntherein is in order.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(d) (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4) (2008).  See also McLendon v. \r\nNicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). \r\n\r\nNotice is also taken that there is a conflict in the record \r\nas to a period of military service of the Veteran from 1961 \r\nto 1965.  The veteran's Department of Defense 214, Report of \r\nTransfer or Discharge, relating to his service from June 1965 \r\nto June 1967 denotes prior active service totaling four \r\nyears, one month, and twenty-four days.  In contrast, \r\ninformation provided to the RO in February 1968, by direction \r\nof the Commandant of the Marine Corps, is to the effect that \r\nservice from June 16, 1961, to April 7, 1965, was inactive \r\nservice.  Further clarification of the dates and type of \r\nservice rendered prior to June 1965 is necessary, and \r\ninasmuch as no service treatment records are on file as to \r\nthat period of service, however characterized, efforts are \r\nalso needed to obtain a complete set of service examination \r\nand treatment records for the earlier period of service.  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(2) (2008).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Undertake those efforts necessary to \r\nensure compliance with the VA's duties to \r\nnotify and assist the Veteran, consistent \r\nwith the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A and 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159, to \r\ninclude notifying him of the information \r\nand evidence still needed to substantiate \r\nhis claim for service connection for a \r\nback disorder.  He should again be \r\nadvised of his right to request \r\nassistance from VA in obtaining the \r\nneeded evidence and information to \r\nsubstantiate his claim for VA \r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nDepending upon the appellant's response, \r\nany and all assistance due him must then \r\nbe provided by VA.\r\n\r\n2.  Verify the exact dates of each and \r\nevery period of active duty, active duty \r\nfor training, and inactive duty training \r\nserved by the Veteran, including a period \r\nof service in the United States Marine \r\nCorps prior to June 1965.  \r\n\r\n3.  Obtain for inclusion in the record a \r\ncomplete set of service examination and \r\ntreatment records for each and every \r\nperiod of active duty, active duty for \r\ntraining, or inactive duty training \r\nserved by the Veteran prior to June 1965.  \r\nEfforts to obtain these and any other \r\nFederal records must continue until the \r\nAMC determines that the records sought do \r\nnot exist or that further efforts to \r\nobtain same would be futile, and, if it \r\nis so determined, then appropriate notice \r\nunder 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(e) must be \r\nprovided to the Veteran and he must then \r\nbe afforded an opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\n4.  Once the actions requested in the \r\nabove indented paragraphs are completed \r\nin full, then and only then should the \r\nVeteran be afforded a VA spine \r\nexamination for the purpose of \r\ndetermining whether any back disability \r\nthat is currently present began during or \r\nas the result of any incident of trauma, \r\nto specifically include multiple injuries \r\nthat are not in dispute.  The veteran's \r\nclaims file in its entirety must be \r\nfurnished to the VA examiner for use in \r\nthe study of this case and the report of \r\nthat examination should indicate whether \r\nin fact the claims folder was made \r\navailable and reviewed.  \r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the relevant \r\nmedical evidence in the claims file, the \r\nclinical evaluation and any tests that \r\nare deemed necessary, the VA examiner is \r\nrequested to address the following \r\nquestion, providing a rationale for any \r\nopinion offered:\r\n\r\nIs it at least as likely as not \r\n(50 percent or greater degree \r\nof probability) that any back \r\ndisability that is currently \r\npresent began during the \r\nVeteran's military service or \r\nis causally linked to any \r\nincident of active duty, to \r\ninclude injuries sustained in \r\nmultiple parachute jumps and \r\nwhile he was engaged in combat \r\nagainst the enemy?  \r\n\r\nUse by the examiner of the \"at least as \r\nlikely as not\" language in responding is \r\nrequired.  The examiner is further \r\nadvised that the term \"as likely as not\" \r\ndoes not mean within the realm of \r\npossibility.  Rather, it means that the \r\nweight of medical evidence both for and \r\nagainst a conclusion is so evenly divided \r\nthat it is medically sound to find in \r\nfavor of causation as to find against \r\ncausation.  More likely and as likely \r\nsupport the contended causal \r\nrelationship; less likely weighs against \r\nthe claim.\r\n\r\n5.  Thereafter, readjudicate the \r\nveteran's claim for service connection \r\nfor a back disorder, including residuals \r\nof back injuries, on the basis of all of \r\nthe evidence of record and all governing \r\nlegal authority.  If the benefit sought \r\non appeal remains denied, the Veteran and \r\nhis representative should be provided \r\nwith a supplemental statement of the \r\ncase, which should contain notice of all \r\nrelevant actions taken on the claim for \r\nbenefits.  An appropriate period of time \r\nshould then be allowed for a response, \r\nbefore the record is returned to the \r\nBoard for further review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran need take no action until otherwise notified.  \r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded to \r\nthe AMC/RO.

Snyder, Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe veteran had active military service from April 1954 to \r\nApril 1957.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a January 2007 rating decision of the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nTogus, Maine.\r\n\r\nIn September 2008, the Veteran, sitting at the RO, testified \r\nduring a hearing conducted via video conference with the \r\nundersigned, sitting at the Board's main office in \r\nWashington, D.C.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the case in December 2008 to the RO, via \r\nthe Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC, for \r\nadditional development.  The AMC/RO completed the additional \r\ndevelopment as directed, continued to deny the claim, and \r\nreturned the case to the Board for further appellate review.  \r\nFor the reasons set forth below, the appeal is again REMANDED \r\nto the RO via AMC.  VA will notify the Veteran if further \r\naction is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn a January 2007 medical opinion the examiner opined the \r\nVeteran's current acquired mental disorder was not causally \r\nrelated to his service-connected hearing loss and tinnitus.  \r\n(Emphasis added).  The Board notes, however, that the Veteran \r\nhas consistently asserted, as noted in his substantive appeal \r\n(VA Form 9) that his depression had its onset near the end of \r\nhis active service, and he has lived with it during the \r\nensuing years.  His VA primary mental health care provider, a \r\nphysician's assistant, concurs with the Veteran's assertion \r\nand opined as much based on the Veteran's history.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was initially reviewed on the basis of secondary \r\nservice connection.  The Veteran's assertions of record, and \r\nthe physician's assistant's opinion places the question of \r\nentitlement to direct service connection at issue and not \r\njust for \"current\" depression.  See Robinson v. Shinseki, \r\n557 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  In light of these factors, \r\nadditional medical input is indicated.\r\n\r\nThe service treatment records of June 1956 suggest there may \r\nbe inpatient or clinical records related to the Veteran's \r\nacoustical trauma injury that are not associated with the \r\nclaims file.  Additional inquiry of the National Personnel \r\nRecords Center is needed to ensure all relevant records are \r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Please send the Veteran a corrective \r\nVCAA notice under 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103(a) \r\nand 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(b), for direct and \r\nsecondary service connection, that \r\nincludes an explanation as to the \r\ninformation or evidence needed to \r\nestablish a disability rating and \r\neffective date for the claim on appeal.\r\n\r\n2.  The AMC/RO shall inquire of the \r\nNational Personnel Records Center as to \r\nwhether there are inpatient or clinical \r\nrecords related to the Veteran's in-\r\nservice exposure to acoustic trauma.  \r\nService treatment records indicate \r\ninpatient treatment may have occurred \r\napproximately in November 1955.  A search \r\nfor the period November to December 1955 \r\nshould be conducted for any clinical \r\nrecords extant.  Any additional service \r\nrecords located should be associated with \r\nthe claims file. \r\n\r\n3.  The AMC/RO should contact the Veteran \r\nand obtain the names, addresses, and \r\napproximate dates of treatment of all \r\nhealth care providers, VA and non-VA, who \r\ntreated the Veteran for an acquired mental \r\ndisorder since October 2008.  After the \r\nVeteran has signed the appropriate \r\nreleases, those records should be obtained \r\nand associated with the claims folder.  All \r\nattempts to procure records should be \r\ndocumented in the file.  If the AMC/RO \r\ncannot obtain records identified by the \r\nVeteran, a notation to that effect should \r\nbe inserted in the file.  The Veteran and \r\nhis representative are to be notified of \r\nunsuccessful efforts in this regard, in \r\norder to allow the veteran the opportunity \r\nto obtain and submit those records for VA \r\nreview.\r\n\r\n4.  After the above is complete, regardless \r\nof whether additional records are obtained, \r\nthe AMC/RO shall refer the claims file back \r\nto the psychologist who conducted the \r\nJanuary 2007 Compensation and Pension \r\nexamination for another comprehensive \r\nreview of the claims file, to include the \r\nservice treatment records and a copy of \r\nthis remand.  Request the examiner to opine \r\nwhether there is at least a 50-50 \r\nprobability the Veteran manifested an \r\nacquired psychosis, or early symptoms of an \r\nacquired mental disorder during active \r\nservice or within the year immediately \r\nfollowing his separation from active \r\nservice.  If so, is any currently diagnosed \r\nacquired mental disorder causally related \r\nto any acquired mental disorder or symptoms \r\nmanifested during active service.  Any \r\nopinion and the rationale for it should be \r\nfully explained.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should specifically comment on \r\nthe findings and opinion of the Veteran's \r\ntreating physician's assistant (i.e., his \r\nprimary VA mental health care provider.)  \r\nAgreement or disagreement should be \r\nindicated and the reasons and bases for it.\r\n\r\nIf the psychologist deems another \r\nexamination necessary to render the \r\nrequested opinion, the AMC/RO shall arrange \r\nit.  The examiner is advised that the \r\nVeteran is a trained psychiatric nurse as \r\nwell as a chiropractic.  Thus, his reported \r\nhistory of depression near the end of his \r\nactive service should be assessed on that \r\nbasis.  Further, please note that the term \r\n\"at least as likely as not\" or a \"50-50 \r\nprobability\" does not mean \"within the \r\nrealm of medical possibility.\" Rather, it \r\nmeans that the weight of medical evidence \r\nboth for and against a conclusion is so \r\nevenly divided that it is as medically \r\nsound to find in favor of that conclusion \r\nas it is to find against it.\r\n\r\nShould the examiner find no relationship \r\nbetween any currently diagnosed psychiatric \r\ndisorder and service, the examiner must \r\ncomment as to whether the Veteran's hearing \r\nloss and/or tinnitus aggravates his \r\nacquired mental disorder-that is, does it \r\nchronically worsen it?  If so, state to \r\nwhat degree or percentage.\r\n\r\n5.  After the foregoing development \r\nrequested has been completed, the AMC/RO \r\nshould review the examination report to \r\nensure that it is in complete compliance \r\nwith the directives of this REMAND.  If the \r\nreport is deficient in any manner, the \r\nAMC/RO must implement corrective procedures \r\nat once.\r\n\r\n6.  Then review the Veteran's claim de novo \r\nin light of any additional evidence \r\nobtained.  If the claim is not granted to \r\nhis satisfaction, send him and his \r\nrepresentative a supplemental statement of \r\nthe case and give them an opportunity to \r\nrespond to it before returning the file to \r\nthe Board for further appellate \r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the case should be returned to the Board, if in \r\norder.  The Board intimates no opinion as to the ultimate \r\noutcome of this case.  The Veteran need take no action unless \r\notherwise notified.  VA will notify him if further action is \r\nrequired on his part.  He has the right to submit additional \r\nevidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has \r\nremanded.

Willett, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1952 to \r\nNovember 1955.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim comes before the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2005 rating decision of \r\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Regional Office (RO) \r\nin St. Petersburg, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe Board again notes that in an October 2007 letter the \r\nVeteran indicated a desire to withdraw the representation of \r\nDisabled American Veterans for his appeal. To date, there has \r\nbeen no appointment of a new representative.\r\n\r\nPlease note this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2009). 38 U.S.C.A. \r\n\ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2002).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC. VA will notify the appellant \r\nif further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is seeking service connection for PTSD. \r\nEstablishment of service connection for PTSD requires: (1) \r\nmedical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting \r\nevidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually \r\noccurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current \r\nsymptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. \r\n\ufffd 3.304(f). See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\r\n\r\nA \"clear\" diagnosis of PTSD is no longer required. Rather, a \r\ndiagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 4.125(a), which mandates that, for VA purposes, all \r\nmental disorder diagnoses must conform to the fourth edition \r\nof the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and \r\nStatistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). See 38 \r\nC.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f). The United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims (Court) has taken judicial notice of the \r\nmental health profession's adoption of the DSM-IV as well as \r\nits more liberalizing standards to establish a diagnosis of \r\nPTSD. The Court acknowledged the change from an objective \r\n\"would evoke . . . in almost anyone\" standard in assessing \r\nwhether a stressor is sufficient to trigger PTSD to a \r\nsubjective standard (e.g., whether a person's exposure to a \r\ntraumatic event and response involved intense fear, \r\n\r\n\r\nhelplessness, or horror). Thus, as noted by the Court, a more \r\nsusceptible person could have PTSD under the DSM-IV criteria \r\ngiven his or her exposure to a traumatic event that would not \r\nnecessarily have the same effect on \"almost everyone.\" Cohen, \r\n10 Vet. App. 128, 140-141 (1997).\r\n\r\nIf the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in \r\ncombat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to \r\nthat combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence \r\nto the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is \r\nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships \r\nof the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone \r\nmay establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service \r\nstressor. \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.304(f)(1). See also 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 1154(b). The \r\nordinary meaning of the phrase \"engaged in combat with the \r\nenemy,\" as used in 38 U.S.C. \ufffd 1154(b), requires that a \r\nVeteran have participated in events constituting an actual \r\nfight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or \r\ninstrumentality. The issue of whether any particular set of \r\ncircumstances constitutes engagement in combat with the enemy \r\nfor purposes of section 1154(b) must be resolved on a case-\r\nby-case basis. See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).\r\n\r\nHere, a verified stressor has been conceded by the RO. The \r\nVeteran's DD214 Form indicates he holds the Combat \r\nInfantryman Badge (CIB). This is prima fascia evidence the \r\nVeteran engaged in combat against enemy forces while in the \r\nmilitary. See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999). In several \r\nSeptember 2006 statements the Veteran alleges he was exposed \r\nto traumatic experiences in combat, including living through \r\nmortar attacks, witnessing mutilated bodies in the aftermath, \r\nand accidentally causing the death of an officer in charge by \r\nfriendly fire. As these experiences are consistent with the \r\nfacts and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the \r\nstressor is deemed verified.\r\n\r\nIn May 2008, the Board remanded this matter in order to \r\nafford the Veteran a VA examination to determine the nature \r\nand etiology of his PTSD. The Board pointed out in the remand \r\nthat the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in a June 2006 \r\ntreatment record from the State of Florida Department of \r\nCorrections. In the case of \r\n\r\n\r\na disability compensation claim, VA's duty to assist includes \r\nproviding a medical examination or obtaining a medical \r\nopinion when necessary to make a decision on the claim. 38 \r\nU.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(d) (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4) \r\n(2009). Such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a \r\ndecision on a claim if all of the lay and medical evidence of \r\nrecord (1) contains competent evidence that the claimant has \r\na current disability, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of \r\ndisability; and (2) indicates that the disability or symptoms \r\nmay be associated with the claimant's active military, naval, \r\nor air service; but (3) does not contain sufficient medical \r\nevidence for VA to make a decision on the claim. Id. Because \r\nthe Veteran's stressors are conceded and because clinical \r\nevidence suggests that he is treated for PTSD, the Board \r\ndeemed an examination necessary to decide the claim.\r\n\r\nThe Board clarified that it is cognizant that the Veteran is \r\nincarcerated and serving two life sentences. The Board notes \r\nthat it appears the Veteran has been scheduled for VA \r\nexaminations in the past but was reported as having failed to \r\nappear due to a lack of transportation to the VA facility. \r\nThe Board points out that the United States Court of Appeals \r\nfor Veterans Claims (Court) has long held that incarcerated \r\nVeterans \"are entitled to the same care and consideration \r\ngiven to their fellow Veterans.\" See Bolton v. Brown, 8 Vet. \r\nApp. 185, 191 (quoting Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 \r\n(1991)). Further, the Court has cautioned \"those who \r\nadjudicate claims of incarcerated Veterans to be certain that \r\nthey tailor their assistance to the peculiar circumstances of \r\nconfinement.\" Id. In Bolton, the Court held that a remand was \r\nnecessary for VA to make further efforts to conduct a medical \r\nexamination at the site of a correctional facility. Id. at \r\n191.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the RO should take reasonable steps to attempt to \r\nschedule the Veteran for the examination in connection with \r\nthe claim for service connection for PTSD.  The VA \r\nAdjudication Procedure Manual may be helpful in this \r\ninstance. It contains a provision for scheduling examinations \r\nof incarcerated Veterans. The manual calls for the AOJ or the \r\nlocal Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Medical \r\nExamination Coordinator to confer with prison authorities to \r\ndetermine whether the Veteran should be escorted to a VA \r\nmedical facility for examination by VHA personnel. If that is \r\nnot possible, the Veteran may be examined at the prison by: \r\n(1) VHA personnel; (2) prison medical providers at VA \r\nexpense; or (3) fee-basis providers contracted by VHA. See \r\nM21-1MR, Part III.iv.3.A.11.d (2009).  If this is not \r\npossible, the record must contain evidence of substantial \r\nefforts to conduct such examination, including identifying \r\nand requesting the assistance of the appropriate state or \r\nprison official.  \r\n\r\nOn remand, the Board ordered that the RO must either afford \r\nthe Veteran a formal VA psychiatric examination at a VA \r\nfacility, or if that is not possible, coordinate efforts with \r\nthe correctional facility to accommodate the Veteran by \r\narranging for an examination to be conducted at the \r\ncorrectional facility at which he is incarcerated to \r\ndetermine whether it is at least as likely as not that his \r\nPTSD is related to service. If it is not possible to have him \r\nexamined at the prison facility, in light of Bolton and Wood, \r\nthe Board concluded that a VA examiner should review the \r\nVeteran's medical records and opine as to whether it is at \r\nleast as likely as not that his PTSD developed as a result of \r\nhis in-service stressors.\r\n\r\nA review of the claims folder since the remand reveals that a \r\nVA examination was deemed impossible due to the rules and \r\nregulations of the correctional facility being incompatible \r\nwith VA policy. See November 2008 notation in the claims \r\nfolder. In April 2009, the claims folder was reviewed by a VA \r\nexaminer without the benefit of examination of the Veteran \r\nand an opinion rendered. The examiner reported that he \r\nreviewed the claims folder, but that he \"was unable to find \r\nany record that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD,\" \r\nnoting only his other diagnoses, including sexual disorders, \r\nsociopathy and passive-aggressive personality disorder, none \r\nof which were deemed secondary to his traumatic experiences \r\nin combat. The Board does not find this examiner's opinion \r\nadequate for rating purposes. While the examiner clearly \r\nstated that he had reviewed the claims folder, it does not \r\nappear that such a review actually took place. The examiner's \r\ninability to find any record that the Veteran has been \r\ndiagnosed with PTSD is inconsistent with a review of the \r\nclaims folder. As was noted in the Board's previous remand, \r\nthe Veteran began treatment for symptoms related to PTSD in \r\nJune 2006. See State of Florida Department of Corrections \r\nrecords. Additional records have been added to the claims \r\nfolder since the remand, and the PTSD diagnosis was again \r\nreported in September 2006 and May 2008, with reports of \r\nflashbacks and nightmares in February 2008. It is entirely \r\nunclear how an examiner that reviewed the claims folder could \r\nhave been \"unable to find any record that the Veteran has \r\nbeen diagnosed with PTSD.\"\r\n\r\nBecause the Board ordered a VA opinion as to the nature and \r\netiology of the Veteran's claimed PTSD, and no adequate \r\nopinion was obtained, the Board finds that the directives of \r\nthe May 2008 Remand were not complied with. If any action \r\nrequired by a remand is not undertaken, or is taken in a \r\ndeficient manner, appropriate corrective action should be \r\nundertaken. While the Board regrets the delay, another remand \r\nis required. See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's \r\ndocket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2009). Expedited \r\nhandling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  Take appropriate steps to obtain \r\nupdated medical records pertaining to \r\npsychiatric treatment for the Veteran from \r\nthe correctional institution where he is \r\nincarcerated.  Associate updated medical \r\nrecords with the claims folder.  \r\n\r\n2. Thereafter, take all reasonable \r\nmeasures to schedule the Veteran for VA \r\nPTSD examination.  Confer with prison \r\nauthorities to determine whether the \r\nVeteran may be escorted to a VA medical \r\nfacility for the examination or if an \r\nexamination at the prison is feasible. See \r\nM21-1MR, Part III.iv.3.A.11.d.\r\n\r\nThe entire claims file, to include a \r\ncomplete copy of this REMAND, must be \r\nprovided to the physician designated to \r\nexamine the Veteran, and the examination \r\nreport should reflect consideration of the \r\nVeteran's documented medical history and \r\nassertions. All indicated tests and \r\nstudies, to include psychological testing, \r\nif deemed warranted, should be \r\naccomplished (with all findings made \r\navailable to the physician prior to the \r\ncompletion of his or her report) and all \r\nclinical findings should be reported in \r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should confirm or rule out \r\nthe diagnosis of PTSD, and, if the \r\ndiagnosis is confirmed, determine the \r\netiology of the Veteran's PTSD. In \r\nparticular, the examiner should indicate \r\nthe stressor(s) underlying that diagnosis, \r\nand comment as to whether it is at least \r\nas likely as not that any PTSD is related \r\nto those stressors, or otherwise had its \r\nonset during service.  ).  If this is not \r\npossible, the record must contain evidence \r\nof substantial efforts to conduct such \r\nexamination, including identifying and \r\nrequesting the assistance of the \r\nappropriate state or prison official.  \r\n\r\nIf the examination could not be \r\naccomplished because such arrangements \r\ncould not be made with the State \r\ninstitution where the Veteran resides, the \r\nRO should forward the claims file to a VA \r\npsychiatrist (M.D.), obtain a medical \r\nopinion that addresses all of the \r\nquestions posed above.\r\n\r\nThe psychiatrist should set forth all \r\nexamination findings (if any), along with \r\nthe complete rationale for the conclusions \r\nreached, in a typewritten report.\r\n\r\n3.

Ishizawar, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty from \r\nJanuary 1965 to May 1967, and from October 1972 to November \r\n1975 had several periods of active duty for training \r\n(ACDUTRA).  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' \r\nAppeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2004 rating \r\ndecision of the Montgomery, Alabama Department of Veterans \r\nAffairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In March 2007, a \r\nvideoconference hearing was held before the undersigned.  A \r\ntranscript of the hearing is associated with the Veteran's \r\nclaims file.  In June 2007, the case was remanded for \r\nadditional development and to satisfy notice requirements.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the \r\nappellant if any action on her part is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), \r\n38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 \r\n(West 2002) and the regulations implementing it apply in the \r\ninstant case.  While the notice provisions of the VCAA appear \r\nto be satisfied, the Board is of the opinion that further \r\ndevelopment of the record is required to comply with VA's \r\nduty to assist the Veteran in the development of the facts \r\npertinent to his claim.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2009).\r\n\r\nIn the June 2007 remand, the Board noted that the Veteran had \r\ntestified at her March 2007 videoconference hearing that she \r\nwas being treated at VA for her psychiatric disorder, and \r\nthat VA treatment records since August 2003 had not been \r\nassociated with the claims file.  As such records are \r\nconstructively of record, it was requested that they be \r\nsecured.  It was also noted that the Veteran had testified \r\nthat she was receiving treatment at the Vet Centers in Mobile \r\nand Biloxi from social worker T.J.G., and that only an \r\nOctober 2003 letter from T.J.G. was of record.  As such \r\nrecords are also constructively of record, it was instructed \r\nthat any reports generated by the Veteran's sessions at the \r\nMobile or Biloxi Vet Centers be secured for the claims file.  \r\nUpon close review of the record, the Board finds that such \r\ndevelopment has not been completed.  A remand by the Board \r\nconfers on the appellant, as a matter of law, the right to \r\ncompliance with the remand orders.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. \r\nApp. 268, 271 (1998).  \r\n\r\nRegarding the request for updated (post-August 2003) VA \r\ntreatment records, the Board notes that the November 2009 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case (SSOC) identifies March \r\n2005 to May 2005 progress notes from the Mobile Outpatient \r\nClinic as having been associated with the record.  However, \r\nthe Board was not able to locate such records in the \r\nVeteran's claims file.  [The Board notes that records \r\nreceived since the June 2007 remand include November 2002 to \r\nAugust 2003 Mobile Outpatient Clinic records; however, these \r\nrecords were received as part of the Veteran's Social \r\nSecurity Administration (SSA) records, and are also limited \r\nto records prior to August 2003.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the request for records from the Mobile and Biloxi \r\nVet Centers, the Board notes that the AMC requested such \r\nrecords in June 2007.  In response, in August 2007, the \r\nVeteran submitted a July 2007 \"Summary of Treatment for \r\nSexual Trauma/Harassment\" from T.J.G.  This letter, \r\nessentially, reiterates the information that was included in \r\nher October 2003 and February 2005 letters.  It specifically \r\nidentifies the Veteran as her client at the Mobile Vet Center \r\nfrom June 4, 2003 (and indicates that the Veteran then \r\ntransferred her treatment to the Biloxi Vet Center with \r\nT.J.G. on July 8, 2004).  The Veteran attended both \r\nindividual and group therapy sessions at the Vet Centers \r\nuntil March 2005.  She was then referred back to the Mobile \r\nVet Center.  In April 2007, she began treatment with a \r\nprivate counselor and physician in the Mobile, Alabama area.  \r\nRecords generated by the individual and group therapy \r\nsessions have not been associated with the claims file (as \r\nwas requested in the June 2007 remand).\r\n\r\nFinally, the Veteran has advised that in April 2007, she \r\nbegan treatment with P.R. at East Bay Psychiatry & \r\nAssociates, LLC.  In March 2009, she advised that P.R. was \r\nnow associated with Coastal Counseling & Consulting, and that \r\nshe had transferred her medical records to P.R.'s new office.  \r\nRecords of this treatment are likely to contain pertinent \r\nevidence/information, and must be secured.  The RO twice (in \r\nMay 2009 and in July 2009) attempted to secure these private \r\ntreatment records, to no avail.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran is advised that under 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(1), VA \r\nwill make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not \r\nin the custody of a Federal department or agency, but that it \r\nis her responsibility to ensure that the records are received \r\nif the RO is unable to obtain them.  She is further advised \r\nthat governing regulation provides that where evidence \r\nrequested in connection with an original claim is not \r\nreceived within a year of the request, the claim will \r\n(emphasis added) be considered abandoned (and the appeal in \r\nthe matter would be dismissed).  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.158(a). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following:\r\n\r\n1. \tThe RO should ask the Veteran to \r\nidentify the provider(s) of any additional \r\npsychiatric treatment or evaluation she \r\nhas received, records of which are not \r\nalready associated with the claims file, \r\nand to provide any releases necessary for \r\nVA to secure records of such treatment or \r\nevaluation.  The RO must (as the Board's \r\nprevious remand instructed) obtain \r\ncomplete clinical records of all such \r\ntreatment and evaluation from the sources \r\nidentified by the Veteran, specifically \r\nincluding records of VA treatment the \r\nVeteran has received since August 2003, \r\nand records of any individual and group \r\ntherapy sessions the Veteran has attended \r\nat the Mobile and Biloxi Vet Centers.  The \r\nRO should also once again attempt more to \r\nsecure private treatment records from \r\nP.R./Coastal Counseling & Consulting.  If \r\nthe records are not received pursuant to \r\nthe RO's request, the Veteran should be \r\nadvised that ultimately it is her \r\nresponsibility to ensure that these \r\nrecords are received.\r\n\r\n2. \tThe RO should arrange for any \r\nfurther development suggested by the \r\nresults of the development sought above, \r\nand then re-adjudicate the claim.  If it \r\nremains denied, the RO should issue an \r\nappropriate SSOC and afford the Veteran \r\nand her representative the opportunity to \r\nrespond.  The case should then be returned \r\nto the Board, if in order, for further \r\nreview.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky \r\nv. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  This claim must be \r\nafforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all \r\nclaims that are remanded by the Board for additional \r\ndevelopment or other appropriate action must be handled in an \r\nexpeditious manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nGeorge R.

M. Schaefer, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 2001 to December \r\n2001 and from November 2002 to August 2003.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a rating decision issued in December 2006 by the \r\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in \r\nMuskogee, Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nWhen the record associates different diagnoses with the same \r\nsymptoms, the nature of the Veteran's disorder is a question of \r\nfact for the Board, and once determined, the Board must address \r\nwhether the Veteran's symptoms, regardless of diagnosis, are \r\nrelated to service.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 \r\n(2009) (holding that when a claimant makes a claim, he is seeking \r\nservice connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms \r\nare diagnosed or labeled).  In this case, the Veteran filed a \r\nclaim for service connection for PTSD, but the treatment evidence \r\nshows diagnoses of multiple acquired psychiatric disorders, \r\nincluding PTSD, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), \r\nbipolar disorder, and psychosis NOS.  Therefore, the Board has \r\nbroadened the issue for consideration to include all diagnosed \r\nacquired psychiatric disorders.  As this change affords the \r\nVeteran more avenues for success in his claim, the Board sees no \r\nprejudice in doing so.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management \r\nCenter (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the Veteran if \r\nfurther action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nFirst, a review of the record shows that the Veteran's service \r\npersonnel records have been deemed unavailable.  The Board notes \r\nthat three requests were mailed to the Oklahoma National Guard, \r\nand no response was received, and that a request to the National \r\nPersonnel Records Center (NPRC) yielded a negative response.  \r\nHowever, the record reflects that the Veteran's service treatment \r\nrecords were received from the National Guard after a phone call \r\nwas made to the unit.  Thus, the Board determines that the \r\nNational Guard should be contacted directly via telephone to \r\nascertain whether the Veteran's service personnel records are, in \r\nfact, available. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Board observes that the Veteran not been \r\nprovided with a VA examination.  VA has a duty to provide a VA \r\nexamination when the record lacks evidence to decide the \r\nVeteran's claim and there is evidence of (1) a current \r\ndisability, (2) an in-service event, injury, or disease, and (3) \r\nsome indication that the claimed disability may be associated \r\nwith the established event, injury, or disease.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd \r\n3.159; See also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  \r\nIn this regard, the Board observes that the Veteran has been \r\ndiagnosed with multiple psychiatric disorders, and there is some \r\nindication in lay statements and treatment records that his \r\nsymptoms began in service or are related to an event in service.  \r\nTherefore, the Board determines that the Veteran should be \r\nscheduled for a VA examination to determine the existence and \r\netiology of his claimed acquired psychiatric disorder. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.\tContact the Oklahoma National Guard via \r\ntelephone to inquire as to whether the \r\nVeteran's service personnel records are \r\navailable.  All requests and responses, \r\npositive and negative, should be \r\nassociated with the claims file. \r\n\r\n2.\tSchedule the Veteran for a VA examination \r\nin order to ascertain the existence and \r\netiology of his claimed acquired \r\npsychiatric disorder.  The claims file \r\nshould be made available for review, and \r\nthe examination report should reflect that \r\nsuch review occurred.  The examiner should \r\nelicit a complete history from the \r\nVeteran.\r\n\r\nUpon a review of the record and \r\nexamination of the Veteran, the examiner \r\nshould respond to the following:\r\n\r\na.\tIdentify the most appropriate \r\ndiagnosis for the Veteran's \r\npsychiatric symptoms. \r\n\r\nb.\tIs it at least as likely as not \r\n(50 percent probability or greater) \r\nthat any acquired psychiatric \r\ndisorder exhibited by the Veteran \r\ncurrently was present in service or \r\nis causally or etiologically related \r\nto an event or injury in service?\r\n\t\t\r\nA rationale for any opinion advanced \r\nshould be provided.  The examiner should \r\nalso state what sources were consulted in \r\nforming the opinion.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Veteran is hereby notified that it is \r\nhis responsibility to report for any \r\nexamination, and to cooperate in the \r\ndevelopment of the claim.  The \r\nconsequences for failure to report for a \r\nVA examination without good cause may \r\ninclude denial of the claim.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd \r\n3.158, 3.655.\r\n\r\n4.\tAfter completing the above actions and any \r\nother development indicated by any \r\nresponse received as a consequence of the \r\nactions taken in the preceding paragraphs, \r\nthe Veteran's service connection claim \r\nshould be readjudicated, to include all \r\nevidence received since the January 2008 \r\nsupplemental statement of the case.  If \r\nthe claim remains denied, the Veteran and \r\nhis representative should be issued \r\nanother supplemental statement of the \r\ncase.  An appropriate period of time \r\nshould be allowed for response.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and \r\nargument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. \r\nWest, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of \r\nVeterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for \r\nVeterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate \r\naction must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Kessel, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from September 1987 to \r\nAugust 1992.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) \r\non appeal from a December 2007 rating decision of the Department \r\nof Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in North Little \r\nRock, Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIn September 2009, the Veteran testified at a hearing before the \r\nBoard.  At the hearing and subsequent to the hearing, the Veteran \r\nsubmitted additional evidence to the Board in the form of private \r\nmedical records.  The Veteran waived review of the newly \r\nsubmitted evidence by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1304(c) (2010).  Thus, the Board will consider \r\nsuch evidence in the adjudication of this appeal.  In any case, \r\ngiven the Board's disposition of the case, the AOJ will have an \r\nopportunity to review the evidence on remand.\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability resulting \r\nfrom disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active \r\nmilitary service.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 1110, 1131 (West 2002); \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.303, 3.304 (2010).  Service connection may also be \r\ngranted for disability that is proximately due to or aggravated \r\nby service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310 \r\n(2010).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran primarily asserts that she has a low back disability, \r\nincluding lumbosacral strain, related to her service-connected \r\nleft foot disabilities.  Specifically, she states that the left \r\nfoot disabilities caused an altered gait that then resulted in a \r\nlow back disability.  Therefore, the Veteran contends that \r\nservice connection is warranted on a secondary basis.  \r\nAdditionally, the Veteran notes that she was treated for low back \r\npain during military service.  Thus, service connection for a low \r\nback disability on a direct basis is reasonably raised by the \r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nVA will provide a medical examination when there is:  (1) \r\ncompetent evidence of a current disability or persistent or \r\nrecurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing \r\nthat an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or \r\nestablishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable \r\npresumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; and (3) an \r\nindication that the disability or persistent or recurrent \r\nsymptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's \r\nservice or with another service-connected disability; but \r\ninsufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a \r\ndecision on the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(d)(2) (West \r\n2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(4)(i) (2010); McLendon v. Nicholson, \r\n20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has been awarded service connection for multiple \r\ndisabilities, including:  residuals of a left ankle sprain with \r\nchronic instability, evaluated as 20 percent disabling; status \r\npost McBride's left foot bunionectomy and Reverdin's osteotomy of \r\nthe first metatarsal and plantar fasciitis with heel pain, \r\nevaluated as 20 percent disabling; and scar of the left foot, \r\nevaluated as 10 percent disabling.  \r\n\r\nPrivate medical records show that the Veteran has been treated \r\nfor low back pain and has been diagnosed with lumbosacral strain.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran submitted a letter from chiropractor J.S, dated in \r\nSeptember 2009.  J.S. stated that the Veteran's foot pain could, \r\nat times, cause her lower back pain to worsen.  It was noted that \r\nthe Veteran's gait cycle is altered when her feet hurt and it can \r\ncause her back condition to worsen.\r\n\r\nTreating physician Dr. B.K., in an October 2009 letter, stated \r\nthat the Veteran has chronic lumbosacral strain and pain.  Dr. \r\nB.K. stated that the pain the Veteran has in her feet could \r\npossibly be related to her back.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has not yet been provided a VA medical examination in \r\nconnection with this claim.  Given that the Veteran has service-\r\nconnected left foot disabilities, that she has lumbosacral \r\nstrain, and that there is at least an indication that the two may \r\nbe related, the Board finds that the claim should be remanded for \r\na VA medical examination.  In addition to an examination of the \r\nVeteran's low back, an opinion should be provided that addresses \r\nwhether the Veteran has a low back disability that was caused or \r\nhas been made chronically worse by her service-connected left \r\nfoot disabilities.  In accordance with 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.310(b), if \r\nthe designated examiner determines that a service-connected \r\ndisability has made a low back disability chronically worse, the \r\nexaminer should comment on whether any of the evidence of record \r\nconstitutes a baseline of the level of severity of the low back \r\ndisability.  The examiner should then provide an opinion as to \r\nhow much the low back disability has worsened in severity as a \r\nresult of the natural progress of the disability, if at all, from \r\nthe time of the baseline to the current level of severity.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records include a December 1991 \r\nentry of a complaint of low back pain.  The assessment was a \r\npositive test for pregnancy and the Veteran was prescribed pain \r\nmedication for a back ache.  In addition to the secondary nexus \r\nopinion described above, the designated examiner should address \r\nwhether the Veteran has a low back disability as a result of her \r\nactive military service, including the December 1991 complaint of \r\nlow back pain.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has received treatment at the VA Medical Center \r\n(VAMC) in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Should additional treatment \r\nrecords from that facility exist, they should be obtained in \r\nlight of the remand.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain the Veteran's more recent \r\ntreatment records (since October 2005) from \r\nthe Little Rock VAMC and associate the \r\nrecords with the claims folder.\r\n\r\n2.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA \r\nexamination of her low back.  (Advise the \r\nVeteran that failure to appear for an \r\nexamination as requested, and without good \r\ncause, could adversely affect her appeal.  \r\nSee 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.655 (2010).)  The entire \r\nclaims file, to include a complete copy of \r\nthis remand, should be made available to, \r\nand reviewed by, the designated examiner.  \r\nAll appropriate tests and studies, \r\nincluding x-rays, should be performed and \r\nall clinical findings should be reported in \r\ndetail.  The examiner should provide an \r\nopinion, based on a thorough review of the \r\nevidence of record, as to the medical \r\nprobabilities that the Veteran has a low \r\nback disability that was caused or has been \r\nmade chronically worse by her service-\r\nconnected left foot disabilities (residuals \r\nof a left ankle sprain with chronic \r\ninstability, status post McBride's left \r\nfoot bunionectomy and Reverdin's osteotomy \r\nof the first metatarsal and plantar \r\nfasciitis with heel pain, and scar of the \r\nleft foot).  If the examiner finds that the \r\nleft foot disabilities have an effect on a \r\nlow back disability, the examiner should \r\ncomment on when the onset of \"aggravation\" \r\ntook place and whether the claims file \r\ncontains sufficient medical evidence \r\ncreated before the onset of aggravation to \r\nestablish a baseline of the level of \r\nseverity of any low back disability.  If a \r\nbaseline is established, the examiner \r\nshould comment on how much the low back \r\ndisability has worsened in severity as a \r\nresult of the natural progress of the \r\ndisability, if at all, from the time of the \r\nbaseline to the current level of severity.  \r\nThe examiner should also provide an opinion \r\nas to the medical probabilities that the \r\nVeteran has a low back disability that is \r\nrelated to her active military service, \r\nincluding a December 1991 complaint of low \r\nback pain.  The examiner must provide the \r\ncomplete rationale for the conclusions \r\nreached-to include, as appropriate, \r\ncitation to specific evidence of record \r\nand/or medical authority.\r\n\r\n3.  After the requested examination has \r\nbeen completed, the report should be \r\nreviewed to ensure that it is in complete \r\ncompliance with the directives of this \r\nremand.  If the report is deficient in any \r\nmanner, it should be returned to the \r\nexaminer.\r\n\r\n4.  After undertaking any other development \r\ndeemed appropriate, re-adjudicate the issue \r\non appeal.  If the benefit sought is not \r\ngranted, furnish the Veteran and her \r\nrepresentative with a supplemental \r\nstatement of the case and afford them an \r\nopportunity to respond before the record is \r\nreturned to the Board for further review.\r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any final \r\noutcome warranted.  No action is required of the Veteran until \r\nshe is notified by VA.  The Veteran has the right to submit \r\nadditional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has \r\nremanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThis case must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law \r\nrequires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the \r\nUnited States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional \r\ndevelopment or other appropriate action must be handled in an \r\nexpeditious manner.

Pluta, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from September 1976 to May 1981.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) arises from a December 1994 rating action that denied service connection for asthma.\r\n\r\nBy decisions of July 2004, December 2006, and July 2009, the Board remanded the issue on appeal to the RO for further development of the evidence and for due process development.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is again REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, D.C.  The VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nConsidering the record in light of the duties imposed by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) (38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2010)), the Board finds that all notice and development action needed to render a fair decision on the claim on appeal has not been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that her asthma either had its onset in service or was aggravated thereby.\r\n\r\nAppellate review of the service medical records discloses that the veteran's lungs and chest were normal on March 1976 entrance examination.  She was subsequently treated for asthma on several occasions, and gave an 8-year history of asthma in August 1979.  Chronic asthma was found on May 1981 separation examination.  Post-service private medical records show treatment for asthma beginning in 1986, and the veteran's history of the onset of asthma in her mid-teenage years.  Asthma was diagnosed on April 1994 and July 2008 VA examinations.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, the Board remanded the issue on appeal to the RO to afford the Veteran a VA respiratory examination to determine the nature and etiology of her chronic asthma.  The Veteran failed to report for the examination in August.  However, the Board finds that additional medical information is necessary prior to an appellate decision in this case; specifically, a medical question remains as to whether any pre-existing asthma was aggravated by service.     \r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the Board finds that the RO should forward this case to a VA physician with expertise in respiratory disorders for advisory opinions as to the nature and etiology of the veteran's chronic asthma and its relationship, if any, to her military service, as well as whether any pre-existing asthma was aggravated by service.  \r\n\r\nThe action identified herein is consistent with the duties imposed by the VCAA.  However, identification of specific action requested on remand does not relieve the RO of the responsibility to ensure full compliance with the VCAA and its implementing regulations.  Hence, in addition to the action requested above, the RO should also undertake any other development and/or notification action deemed warranted by the VCAA prior to adjudicating the claim on appeal.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this matter is hereby REMANDED to the RO via the AMC for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO should forward this case to a VA physician with expertise in respiratory disorders for advisory opinions as to the nature and etiology of the veteran's chronic asthma and its relationship, if any, to her military service, as well as whether any pre-existing asthma was aggravated by service.  \r\n\r\nThe doctor should specifically review the evidence in the claims folder, to include the service and post-service medical records, and render opinions for the record as to (a) whether, on the basis of the available evidence, any currently-diagnosed asthma clearly and unmistakably existed prior to the veteran's military service; and if so, (b) whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., there is at least a 50% probability), or is not at least as likely as not (i.e., there is less than a 50% probability) that such asthma increased in severity during her military service, or was aggravated by any incident thereof.  If any pre-existing asthma is found to have increased in severity during service, the physician should specifically address the matters of (a) whether such increase in severity was due to the natural progress of the condition, and (b) whether the underlying asthma disability, as opposed to just the symptoms, worsened during service.\r\n\r\nIn reaching his opinions, the doctor should provide a detailed discussion of the veteran's documented medical history and assertions, and set forth the complete rationale for the conclusions and opinions reached in a printed (typewritten) report.\r\n\r\n2.  To help avoid future remand, the RO must ensure that all requested action has been accomplished (to the extent possible) in compliance with this REMAND.  If any action is not undertaken, or is taken in a deficient manner, appropriate corrective action should be undertaken.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).\r\n\r\n3.  After completing the requested action, and any additional notification and/or development deemed warranted, the RO should readjudicate the claim on appeal in light of all pertinent evidence and legal authority.\r\n \r\n4.  If the benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the RO must furnish the appellant an appropriate Supplemental Statement of the Case that includes clear reasons and bases for all determinations, and afford her the appropriate time period for response before the claims folder is returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this REMAND is to afford due process; it is not the Board's intent to imply whether the benefit requested should be granted or denied.  The appellant needs take no action until otherwise notified, but she may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate timeframe.  See Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999); Colon v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 104, 108 (1996); Booth v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 109 (1995); Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 141 (1992).\r\n  \r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5109B, 7112 (West Supp. 2010).\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nF.

The Veteran testified at a Board hearing at the RO in July 2010 before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A copy of the transcript of that hearing has been associated with the record on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that a further VA examination is required before a decision on the merits may be made.  Once the Secretary determines that an examination or opinion is required to decide a claim, VA is required to ensure that such an examination or opinion is adequate; if it is not \"it is incumbent upon the rating board to return the report as inadequate for evaluation purposes.\" 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 4.2; Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 120, 124 (2007) (stating that a medical opinion \"must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions\"); see also Hicks v. Brown, 8 Vet.App. 417, 422 (1995) (concluding that inadequate medical evaluation frustrates judicial review). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA psychiatric examination in April 2005.  The examiner did not provide a nexus opinion.  The examiner did note that the Veteran's symptoms started while he was in service and continue until this day.  The examiner did not provide a rationale for this statement.  He also did not review the claims file or service treatment records.  The statement appears to be merely a recitation of the Veteran's lay history.  A mere recitation of the Veteran's self-reported lay history does not constitute competent medical evidence of diagnosis or causality.  Sanchez-Benitez v. West, 13 Vet. App. 282 (1999); LeShore v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 406 (1995) (unenhanced medical information recorded by a medical examiner).   Therefore, the Board finds that further examination is necessary to provide a medical opinion with a rationale to include a review of the claims file and service treatment records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, during the July 2010 Board hearing the Veteran stated that he receives Social Security Administration benefits related to his psychiatric disability.  VA must attempt to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency unless further attempts would be futile.  These records include medical and other records from SSA.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(2).  In Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363, 370 (1992), the CAVC found that VA's duty to assist specifically includes requesting information from other Federal departments.  In Baker v. West, 11 Vet. App. 163, 169 (1998), the CAVC further stated that VA is required to obtain evidence from other agencies, including decisions of the SSA.  The Veteran's SSA records are not associated with the claims file.  Therefore, the Board finds that remand is also necessary to obtain SSA records.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified that he was admitted to Napa State Hospital in Napa, California for treatment of a psychiatric disability in 1982 or 1983.  He also testified that he is currently receiving treatment from VA at the Panama City Beach VA clinic.  Because VA is on notice that there are additional records that may be applicable to the Veteran's claims and because these records may be of use in deciding the claims, these records are relevant and should be obtained.  Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO/AMC should attempt to obtain and associate with the file any SSA records related to his psychiatric disabilities.  The RO should document any attempts to obtain these records.\r\n\r\n2.  The RO/AMC should attempt to obtain all records associated with the Veteran's hospitalization at Napa State Hospital in Napa, California in 1982 and/or 1983.  If no records can be found, that fact should be noted in the claims file.\r\n\r\n3.  The RO/AMC should obtain all VA treatment records for the Veteran from the Panama City Beach VA clinic dated from January 2008 to the present.\r\n\r\n4.  The Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination to ascertain the nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric disability.  The relevant documents in the claims file, to include service treatment records, should be made available to and reviewed by the examiner in connection with the new examination.  Any tests deemed medically advisable should be accomplished.  The examiner should list all current psychiatric disabilities and clearly address the following:\r\n\r\nAs to any current psychiatric disability, the examiner should offer an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or higher degree of probability) that the Veteran's disability had its onset during service or is causally or etiologically related to service.  The examiner should discuss the Veteran's reported history of symptoms since service separation.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale should be given for any opinion provided.\r\n\r\n5.  After completion of the above and any other development the RO/AMC should deem necessary, the RO/AMC should review the expanded record and readjudicate the claim.  If the claim remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished an appropriate supplemental statement of the case, and should be afforded an opportunity to respond.  Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for appellate review, if otherwise in order.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  The Veteran is advised to appear and participate in any scheduled VA examination, as failure to do so may result in denial of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.655 (2010).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Thus, his request for a Board hearing is deemed withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.704(d) (2011).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is claiming entitlement to service connection for varicose veins of the left leg, due to events that occurred during service.  The Board has determined that before it can adjudicate the Veteran's appeal, additional development is required.  \r\n\r\nOf record is a September 2009 inquiry response from the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicating that the Veteran is in receipt of SSA disability benefits.  Apart from this inquiry, no SSA records are contained in the Veteran's claims file, nor is there an indication that the RO attempted to obtain these records.  Because the available SSA information does not state the disability compensated, the Board cannot rule out the potential relevance of these records.  VA therefore has a duty to make reasonable efforts to obtain these records.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c)(2); see Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (finding that if there is a reasonable possibility that SSA records are relevant to a claim, VA is required to assist the claimant in obtaining the identified records).  Both the SSA decision and the supporting medical records must be obtained.  See Dixon v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 168, 171 (2000); Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181, 188 (1992).\r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that the Veteran provides a history of in-service treatment for his varicose veins through the Army Medical Center at Ft. Benning.  See Veteran's statement dated October 2006.  He recalled being seen on numerous occasions.  While on Remand, a request should be made for those records.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain a copy of any Social Security Administration  decision regarding disability benefits for the Veteran.  All the medical treatment records from the Social Security Administration that were used in considering the Veteran's claim for disability benefits should be obtained and associated with the claims file.  Any negative development should be noted in the record.\r\n\r\n2.  Contact the Ft. Benning Army Medical Center, National Personnel Records Center, or appropriate records agency and request records pertaining to the Veteran's claimed treatment for varicose veins.  Any negative development should be noted in the record.\r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, and after undertaking any additional development deemed necessary, readjudicate the issue on appeal.  If the claim remains denied, issue an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and give the Veteran and his representative the opportunity to respond.  The case should then be returned to the Board, if in order, for further review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.

L. Wallin, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from July 1988 to September 2008. \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2009 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Salt Lake City, Utah, as part of the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program.  The purpose of the BDD program is to help ensure a smooth transition from military to civilian status by allowing service members to file pre-discharge claims for disability compensation with VA.  In order to facilitate the quick processing of claims under the BDD program, the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system is utilized.  Instead of paper, a highly secured electronic repository is used to store and review every document involved in the claims process.  \r\n\r\nBecause the current appeal was processed as part of the Virtual VA system, any future consideration of this Veteran's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the Board in February 2011.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file. \r\n\r\nIn May 2011, the Board denied initial compensable or staged ratings for the service-connected hypertension and bilateral hallux valgus.  These decisions are final, and no further question remains for consideration by the Board in connection with them. \r\n\r\nIn the same decision, the Board remanded the claim of service connection for tinnitus.  The matter was previously before the Board in May 2011 and remanded for further development and adjudication.  As the requested development has not been satisfactorily accomplished, the matter is once again REMANDED.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271   (1998).  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAs noted in the Introduction, the claim was previously before the Board in May 2011.  At that time, the Board determined that additional evidentiary development was necessary.  As the remand orders of the Board were not complied with, further remand is mandated.  Stegall, supra.   \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  He claims that the condition is the result of noise exposure while performing duties as a communications operator and technician with one tour of duty as a drill sergeant.  Notably, he claims that he was exposed to high levels of noise from the employment of small arms, grenades, and power generators.  During his February 2011 Board hearing, the Veteran further elaborated and testified that he experienced tinnitus when in a room with no ambient noise and not in crowded spaces.  He also testified that he needed to keep his television on at night in order to fall asleep. \r\n\r\nThe Board previously determined that the low threshold of McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), had been met.  Specifically, the Board found that the Veteran was competent to report symptoms of tinnitus (ringing in his ears), service records showed he was exposed to high noise levels from the employment of small arms, grenades, and power generators, and there was some suggestion that there was a relationship between the exposure and his current symptoms.  As such, the Board determined that in order to resolve the claim, a Remand was necessary to obtain another VA medical opinion, which was based on full consideration of the Veteran's assertions and which was supported by a clearly stated rationale.  \r\n38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (c) (2012); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App.  303, 311 (2007).\r\n\r\nA VA examination was scheduled for October 2011.  The Veteran failed to appear; however, the Veteran's representative later indicated that the Veteran missed the VA examination as he was working in Kuwait.  See January 2013 statement.  The Veteran's representative has asked for the examination to be rescheduled.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case must again be remanded to effectuate the evidentiary development necessary to fully and fairly adjudicate the Veteran's claim.  The RO is directed to the specific development instructions delineated in the numbered paragraphs herein below and the May 2011 Board Remand is incorporated by reference.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action: \r\n\r\n1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA audiometric examination.  Request that the examiner review the claims file and note review of the claims file in the examination report.  Request that the examiner provide an evaluation of the Veteran's reported symptoms of tinnitus which were not present in July 2008 and provide an opinion whether any disability is at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater possibility) related to exposure to noise from small arms, grenades, power generators or communications transmissions in service. The audiologist must comment on any contribution from post-service activities and on the impact of the disability, if any, on the Veteran's current occupation and daily activities. \r\n\r\n2.  Then, review the claims file to ensure that all the foregoing requested development is completed, and arrange for any additional development indicated.  Then, readjudicate the claim for service connection for tinnitus.  If the benefit sought remains denied, issue an appropriate supplemental statement of the case and provide the Veteran and his representative the requisite time period to respond.  The case should then be returned to the Board for further appellate review, if otherwise in order.  No action is required of the Veteran unless he is notified. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Dale, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from March 1959 to March 1963 with additional service in the United States Naval Reserve.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) on appeal from a January 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota.  \r\n\r\nIn July 2011, the Board remanded the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss claim in order to provide him an opportunity to present oral testimony in support of his claim.  An October 2011 hearing was conducted by the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) of the Board, pursuant to the Board's July 2011 directive.  As such, the Board's prior remand directive has been substantially completed.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97 (2008) (holding that only substantial, and not strict compliance with the terms of a remand request, is required); Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (holding that there was no Stegall violation when the examiner made the ultimate determination required by the Board's remand, because such determination more than substantially complied with the Board's remand order).  \r\n\r\nAlthough the Veteran's bilateral middle ear (eustachian tube) disability claim was discussed at the October 2011 Board hearing, the acceptance of such testimony did not constitute acceptance of jurisdiction of that matter.  In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran had not perfected a timely appeal with respect to this issue, following issuance of a statement of the case.  Indeed, his substantive appeal received in December 2010 was expressly limited to the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  As such, the bilateral middle ear (eustachian tube) disability issue is not for appellate consideration by the Board.  \r\n\r\nAfter the October 2011 Board hearing, the Veteran submitted additional written evidence with a written waiver of RO consideration.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 19.9, 20.1304(c) (2012).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC), in Washington, DC.  VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAfter review of the complete record, the Board concludes that additional development is necessary in order for VA to fulfill its duty to assist the Veteran.  \r\n\r\nThe record before the Board is comprised of the Veteran's paper claims file and electronic Virtual VA file.  However, there is an indication that the record before the Board is not complete.  Specifically, the electronic Virtual VA file includes an April 2012 rating decision, denying another claim filed by the Veteran, which references evidence that is not associated with the paper claims file or electronic Virtual VA file.  As these documents are not available for review, the Board is unaware of their contents, to include whether they are pertinent to claim before the Board.  \r\n\r\nIn light of above, it appears that a temporary file has been created by and maintained at the RO, and thus, the Board is without the benefit of the complete record for review at this time.  The evidence in this temporary file may affect the Veteran's claim on appeal.  On remand, the temporary file must be associated with the paper claims file so that the complete record may be reviewed in connection with appellate adjudication of the issue.  \r\n\r\nFurther, there is an indication that there are outstanding private treatment records which are pertinent to the Veteran's claim.  At the October 2011 hearing, the Veteran testified that he received treatment for his middle ear disability at the Mayo Clinic in the 1970's.  (See the October 2011 hearing transcript at page 10.)  The earliest treatment record from the Mayo Clinic associated with the record is dated in May 1986.  In light of above, on remand, the RO/AMC must request that the Veteran identify and submit a completed authorization for release to VA to all outstanding private treatment records of the Veteran for any ear disability, to include from the Mayo Clinic.  In light of the above as well as the forthcoming changes to the 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A (2)(B), the RO/AMC must make two attempts to obtain any private treatment records identified by the Veteran or make a formal finding that a second request for such records would be futile.  See Pub. L. No. 112-154, \ufffd 505, 126 Stat. 1165, 1193 (2012).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Associate any temporary file, maintained at the RO, with the Veteran's paper claims file, to include the April 2012 rating decision and the evidence referred to therein.  \r\n\r\n2.  Contact the Veteran and request that he identify all outstanding private treatment records which are pertinent to his claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, to include records of treatment for any ear disability at the Mayo Clinic from the 1970's.  Provide the Veteran with several VA Forms 21-4142, and instruct him to complete and submit to VA proper authorizations for release to VA of all records of private treatment at the Mayo Clinic in the 1970's as well as any other outstanding private treatment records identified by him.  After receiving the completed authorizations for release, undertake all appropriate efforts to attempt to obtain these identified records.  In light of the forthcoming changes to the 38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 5103A(2)(B), the RO/AMC must make two attempts for the relevant private treatment records or make a formal findings that a second request for such records would be futile.  See Pub. L. No. 112-154, \ufffd 505, 126 Stat. 1165, 1193 (2012).  All development efforts with respect to this directive should be associated with the claims file. \r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, readjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss in light of all of the evidence of record.  If the benefit sought is not granted to the fullest extent, issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case and afford the Veteran and his representative an appropriate opportunity to respond.  The case should then be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Bordewyk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty for training (ACDUTRA) military service from January 1979 to April 1979.  The Veteran then had a period of active duty from February 2003 to January 2004, to include a tour in the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO) in San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which denied the benefit sought on appeal.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) and Virtual VA paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\nThe Board last remanded this claim in December 2013 for additional development.  Unfortunately, the requested development has not yet been completed.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, this appeal is REMANDED to the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board remanded the claim in December 2013 in order to obtain an opinion as to whether the Veteran's lumbar spine disability was aggravated by his service-connected cervical spine disability.  Although a new examination was provided in January 2014, the examiner did not provide the opinion requested as a rationale was not provided and the examiner did not consider the medical or lay evidence noted in the Board's remand.  \r\n\r\nAs the Board's December 2013 remand order has not been complied with, remand of the issue is necessary.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App 268 (1998) (where the remand orders of the Board are not complied with, the Board errs as a matter of law when it fails to ensure compliance).  \r\n\r\nAll outstanding records of ongoing VA treatment must also be obtained.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Obtain all outstanding VA medical records and associate them with the paper or virtual claims file.  \r\nAll efforts to obtain these records must be documented in the claims file.  Such efforts should continue until they are obtained, it is reasonably certain that they do not exist, or that further efforts would be futile.\r\n\r\n2.  Provide the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate physician to determine whether the Veteran's lumbar spine disorder has been aggravated by his service-connected cervical spine disability.  All indicated tests and studies should be conducted.\r\n\r\nThe claims folder, including this remand and any relevant records contained in the virtual files, must be sent to the examiner for review; consideration of such should be reflected in the completed examination report or in an addendum. \r\n\r\nThe examiner should provide an opinion as to\r\n\r\na) whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the Veteran's current lumbar spine disability was aggravated (made worse as shown by comparing the current disability to medical evidence created prior to any aggravation) by his service-connected cervical spine disability;\r\nb) if the Veteran's current lumbar spine disorder was aggravated by his service-connected cervical spine disability, the examiner should also indicate the extent of such aggravation by identifying the baseline level of disability. \r\n\r\nIn determining whether aggravation has occurred and the baseline of severity, the examiner must consider medical evidence of record, including the result of the January 2007 VA examination, and the Veteran's own statements as to the nature, severity, and frequency of his observable symptoms over time.  This evidence must be specifically discussed in the opinion.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide a rationale for each opinion given.  If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain why this is so and what if any additional evidence would be necessary before an opinion could be rendered. \r\n\r\nThe examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions.\r\n\r\nIf the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports of symptomatology, he or she must provide a reason for doing so.\r\n\r\n3.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) should review the examination report to ensure that it contains the information, opinions, and rationales requested in this remand.\r\n\r\n4.  After completion of all requested and necessary development, the AOJ should review the record in light of the new evidence obtained.  If any benefit for which there is a perfected appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished with a supplemental statement of the case.  Once they are afforded an opportunity to respond, the claim should be returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.

Postek, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1978 to February 2001.  This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2009 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that the Veteran cancelled his September 2012 Board hearing in Washington, DC.  Thus, there is no outstanding Board hearing request.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.702 (2013).  This appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  The Virtual VA electronic claims file contains additional VA treatment records for the development of later claims.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ.  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nRemand is required to provide a VA examination.  The current treatment records show a sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment, and the Veteran has provided competent lay statements from his wife and fellow service members of certain symptoms beginning in service.  Thus, there is evidence that the Veteran's current symptoms may be related to his military service, but insufficient medical evidence to make a decision on the claim.  These considerations satisfy the low threshold for obtaining an examination under VA's duty to assist.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Request that the Veteran provide the names and addresses of any and all health care providers who have provided treatment for his sleep apnea.  After acquiring this information and obtaining any necessary authorization, obtain and associate these records with the claims file.  All information obtained must be made part of the file.  All attempts to secure this evidence must be documented in the claims file, and if, after making reasonable efforts to obtain named records, they are not able to be secured, provide the required notice and opportunity to respond to the Veteran and his representative.\r\n\r\n2.  Contact the appropriate VA Medical Center and obtain and associate with the paper or virtual claims file all outstanding records of treatment, to include VA treatment records from the Atlanta VA Medical Center (Stockbridge CBOC) dated from August 2009 to the present.  If any requested records are not available, or the search for any such records otherwise yields negative results, that fact must clearly be documented in the claims file.  Efforts to obtain these records must continue until it is determined that they do not exist or that further attempts to obtain them would be futile.  The non-existence or unavailability of such records must be verified and this should be documented for the record.  Required notice must be provided to the Veteran and his representative.  \r\n\r\n3.  After any additional records are associated with the claims file, provide the Veteran a VA examination to determine the etiology of any current sleep apnea.  Any studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner must be performed.  The claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner, and it should be confirmed that such records were available for review.  An explanation for all opinions expressed must be provided.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide an opinion, in light of the examination findings and the service and post-service evidence of record, whether it is at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran currently has sleep apnea that manifested in or is otherwise related to his military service.  The examiner must consider the lay statements of record indicating that the Veteran experienced symptoms now attributable to sleep apnea during service (see, e.g., August 2009, March 2011 (with substantive appeal, VA Form 9), and June 2012 written statements), as well as the December 2008 VA treatment record noting possible sleep apnea and the January 2009 private treatment records (Dr. P.R.) diagnosing sleep apnea.\r\n\r\n4.  Notify the Veteran that it is his responsibility to report for any scheduled examination and to cooperate in the development of the claims, and that the consequences for failure to report for a VA examination without good cause may include denial of the claims.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd\ufffd 3.158, 3.655 (2013).  In the event that the Veteran does not report for any scheduled examination, documentation must be obtained which shows that notice scheduling the examination was sent to the last known address.  It must also be indicated whether any notice that was sent was returned as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n5.  After completing the above action, and any other development as may be indicated by any response received as a consequence of the action taken in the paragraphs above, the claim must be readjudicated, to include all evidence received since the February 2011 statement of the case.  If the claim remains denied, a supplemental statement of the case must be provided to the Veteran and his representative.  After the Veteran and his representative have had an adequate opportunity to respond, the appeal must be returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.

Pflugner, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 1983 to August 1983 and from January 1986 to May 1988.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 1993 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Paul, Minnesota.  This appeal was certified to the Board by the RO in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the June 2014 remand, the Board directed the RO to attempt to obtain evidence that was identified by the Veteran, but had not been associated with the claims file.  Specifically, the Veteran stated that he was receiving ongoing psychiatric treatment from private healthcare providers, to include instances of treatment dated in and after February 2013.\r\n\r\nIn June 2014, the RO sent the Veteran a letter requesting that he submit this identified evidence and/or complete and return an enclosed Authorization and Consent to Release Information form in order to enable the RO to attempt to obtain the evidence from the private healthcare providers directly.  After not receiving a response from the Veteran, the RO then obtained a supplemental opinion from the December 2012 VA examiner.  In the resulting report, the examiner noted that private treatment reports dated in and after February 2013, were not available for review.  Subsequently, the RO re-adjudicated the Veteran's claim, confirming and continuing the denial thereof.  The RO issued an August 2014 supplemental statement of the case before returning the Veteran's claim to the Board for further appellate review.\r\n\r\nIn November 2014, the Veteran independently obtained and submitted additional private treatment records, including those dated in and after February 2013.  The Veteran submitted these records without a waiver of initial consideration by the RO.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.1304 (2014).  These records demonstrate ongoing complaints of, diagnoses, and treatment for psychiatric disabilities and, thus, they are pertinent.  Consequently, the Board finds that a remand is warranted in order for the RO to consider in the first instance all of evidence submitted since the August 2014 supplemental statement of the case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, given that the private treatment records dated in and after February 2013 have now been associated with the claims file, the Board finds that a remand is also warranted in order to provide the December 2012 VA examiner with the opportunity to review them and render a supplemental opinion.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (holding that medical opinions based on incomplete factual premise are not probative).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is remanded for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO must make contact the December 2012 VA examiner, who also rendered the July 2013 and August 2014 supplemental opinions, or, if unavailable, an appropriate substitute, in order to obtain another supplemental opinion.  Following review of the claims file and all electronic records, to specifically include those dated in and after February 2013, the examiner must provide an opinion with respect to the following questions:\r\n\r\na) If a diagnosis of personality disorder is still warranted, did the Veteran experience a superimposed disability thereon during either period of his active duty?\r\nb) Is a diagnosis of a psychiatric disability other than a personality disorder warranted at any time during the entire pendency of this appeal, dating back to April 1993?  In addressing this question, the examiner must consider all of the evidence of record, including the evidence dating prior to April 1993.\r\nc) If the answer to b) is in the affirmative, what is the nature of that disability?  Further, was any such disability incurred in, due to, or otherwise etiologically related to either period of the Veteran's active duty?  Did any such disability pre-exist either period of the Veteran's active duty?  If so, upon what evidence is this opinion based upon.  Additionally, if it is found that the disorder pre-existed either period of active duty, was it aggravated beyond its natural course during his active duty?\r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide a complete rationale for all opinions expressed.  If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the examiner must provide the reasons why an opinion would require speculation.  The examiner must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination.  The examiner must indicate whether an opinion could not be rendered due to limitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular examiner.\r\n\r\n2.

R. Fletcher\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active service from June 1989 to August 1989, from May 1992 to February 1997, and an additional seven months of unverified service.\r\n\r\nThis matter was originally before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2007 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky. \r\n\r\nThe Board denied the Veteran's claim in a May 2012 decision.  He appealed his case to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  \r\n\r\nIn a March 2013 Order, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Remand (Joint Motion) filed by counsel for both parties, vacated the Board's May 2012 decision, and remanded the matter to the Board for development consistent with the Joint Motion.  To comply with the Joint Motion, the Board remanded this case for further development in November 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Board then denied the Veteran's claim in a June 2014 decision.  He appealed his case to the Court.  \r\n\r\nIn an April 2015 Order, the Court granted a Joint Motion filed by counsel for both parties, vacated the Board's June 2014 decision, and remanded the matter to the Board for development consistent with the Joint Motion.\r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims processing system.  Accordingly, any future consideration of this case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action on his part is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nIn the June 2014 decision on appeal, the Board denied entitlement to service connection for OSA, based primarily on the findings from a December 2013 VA examination, which determined that the Veteran's current OSA was less likely than not related to service.  \r\n\r\nIn the April 2015 Joint Motion endorsed by the Court, the parties agreed that remand was required because the December 2013 VA examination was inadequate for rating purposes.  Specifically, the VA examiner acknowledged Veteran's reported in-service symptoms of \"head sweats,\" being tired, feeling unrested and \"sleepy,\" but noted that these symptoms can be caused by entities other than sleep apnea.  The examiner also stated that the lay statements indicating that Veteran snored during service were not dispositive because OSA is not the only cause of snoring.  The examiner, however, did not answer the relevant inquiry, which is whether the Veteran's in-service symptoms were at least as likely as not related to OSA.  The fact that Veteran's symptoms \"could\" be caused by other entities does not address whether it is at least as likely as not that these symptoms were caused by sleep apnea.\r\n\r\nOn remand, a new medical opinion that addresses the etiology of the Veteran's OSA should be obtained.  In this regard, the VA examiner should be reminded that a medical examiner cannot rely on the absence of medical records corroborating an injury to conclude that there is no relationship between an appellant's current disability and his military service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 23, 40 (2007).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Return the Veteran's claims file to the examiner who conducted December 2013 VA examination.  If this examiner is not available, then have a VA examiner with appropriate expertise perform the review and render an opinion.\r\n\r\nBased upon the claims file review and sound medical principles, the examiner should answer the following question in this format: Is it at least as likely as not (a 50 percent or better probability) that the Veteran's OSA is etiologically related to his active military service?  \r\n\r\nIn so doing, the examiner must acknowledge and discuss the Veteran's statements that had in-service symptoms of \"head sweats,\" being tired, feeling unrested and \"sleepy,\" and other lay statements indicating that Veteran snored during service.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should explain the rationale for the conclusion reached.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, he or she shall provide a complete explanation stating why this is so.  In so doing, the examiner shall explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question(s).\r\n\r\n2.  Then, undertake any other development determined to be warranted.\r\n \r\n3.  Thereafter, readjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA.  If the benefit sought on appeal remains denied, provide the Veteran and his representative with a supplemental statement of the case and afford them the requisite opportunity to respond before returning the case to the Board for further appellate action.\r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any final outcome warranted.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  See Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the Court for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Accordingly, any future consideration of this Veteran's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for atrial fibrillation, to include as due to his stressful duties in service, as well as herbicide exposure.  Treatment records dated from 1996 through 2012 note treatment for atrial fibrillation.  Further, the Veteran states that he experienced rapid heartbeat in service and intermittently since service.\r\n\r\nRegarding in-service herbicide exposure, the Veteran claims that he was exposed to herbicides in 1974 when he stopped in Saigon, Vietnam while en route to Ramasun Air Force Base (AFB) in Thailand.  He submitted an April 2013 statement from a fellow Air Force veteran to corroborate his account.  The Veteran also asserted that he was exposed to herbicides at Udorn AFB (a Royal Thai AFB) in Thailand, as he was in and around Udorn almost weekly while stationed at Ramasun.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Veteran's claimed herbicide exposure in Vietnam, a Department of the Air Force memorandum confirms that the Veteran's unit was stationed in Ramasun, Thailand between January and August 1974.  The memorandum further noted that the Veteran's unit drew down its operations in Thailand, and thus personnel could have performed TDY travel through Saigon, Vietnam to/from the 6921 SG in 1974.  While the unit histories contained no references to the Veteran, the memorandum indicated that unit histories seldom mention the names of lower ranking personnel, and do not typically contain individual assignment or travel orders. \r\n\r\nConsidering the Veteran's unrebutted reports of his travel to Vietnam corroborated by a service acquaintance, the Board concedes herbicide exposure in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that an examination is warranted to determine if the Veteran has a cardiovascular disease, including disease exhibited by atrial fibrillation, due to Agent Orange exposure or any other incident in service.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Board notes that in his July 2009 formal appeal, the Veteran stated that he was treated for atrial fibrillation at Harrison Hospital in 1982.  However, the RO had previously only requested treatment records from Harrison Hospital since 1991.  Thus, the RO should request the Veteran to authorize VA to obtain such treatment records on his behalf or to submit them directly.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Request that the Veteran complete a VA Form 21-4142, Authorization and Consent to Release Information to VA so that VA may obtain outstanding treatment records from Harrison Hospital beginning in 1982.  The Veteran may also submit these records directly to VA. All requests and responses, positive and negative, must be documented in the claims file.\r\n\r\nIf records are identified but not obtained, the Veteran must be informed of that fact, informed what steps were taken to obtain them, and informed that the claim will be adjudicated without the records but that if he obtains and submits them at a later date the claim may be readjudicated.\r\n\r\n2.  Associate with the claims file all outstanding VA treatment records from June 2012 to the present.\r\n\r\n3.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to assess the nature and etiology of any cardiovascular disease, including disease exhibited by atrial fibrillation, to include whether it is due to presumed Agent Orange exposure.  The claims file and a copy of this Remand must be provided to the examiner and reviewed in conjunction with the examination.  The examiner should specifically indicate whether the Veteran exhibits ischemic heart disease.  \r\n\r\nFor any cardiovascular disease (other than ischemic heart disease) identified, including disease exhibited by atrial fibrillation, the examiner should indicate whether it as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) had its clinical onset in service or is otherwise related to active duty, to include presumed Agent Orange exposure.  \r\n\r\nA complete rationale must be provided for any opinion offered.\r\n\r\n4.  When the above development has been completed, readjudicate the appeal.  If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, issue an additional supplemental statement of the case to the Veteran and his representative. After the Veteran and his representative have had an adequate opportunity to respond, return the appeal to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

L. Marcum, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1981 to April 1987, from September 2001 to October 2001, and from April 2006 to May 2006.  The Veteran had additional service in the National Guard until November 5, 2012.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2013 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in White River Junction, Vermont which denied entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine and for hypertension.  \r\n\r\nIn its July 2015 decision, the Board remanded, in part, the issue of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disorder, to include spondylolisthesis, degenerative joint disease, and degenerative disc disease.  Subsequently, in a November 2015 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disorder.  As this represents a full grant of benefits sought by the Veteran on appeal, this issue is no longer before the Board and will not be discussed herein.  Thus, the only issue that remains on appeal is the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  As discussed below, this issue is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board regrets any further delay in adjudicating the Veteran's claim, but further development is required.\r\n\r\nIn July 2015, the Board remanded the Veteran's claim seeking entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  The purpose of this remand was to provide the Veteran with a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed hypertension.  The Board instructed the VA examiner to clearly indicate whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension; and if so, whether it is \"at least as likely as not\" that the Veteran's hypertension had its onset during or is otherwise medically-related to a period of active duty service or a verified period of ACDUTRA.  In addressing these questions, the VA examiner was also asked to consider and discuss all pertinent in- and post-service medical and other objective evidence, as well as all lay assertions.\r\n\r\nIn October 2015, the Veteran presented for a VA hypertension examination.  After reviewing the evidence of record and evaluating the Veteran, the VA examiner reported that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in 2011 and was started on medications to control hypertension at that time.  Thereafter, the examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension was \"less likely than not\" incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner provided the following rationale in support of this opinion:\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension since 2011.  The Veteran[']s hypertension was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in[-]service hypertension.  The Veteran developed hypertension in 2011 and was released from active duty in 2006.  Therefore was not in service at time of diagnosis.\r\n\r\nReview of the record reveals that VA has a further duty to assist the Veteran in developing evidence pertinent to his claim.  As an initial matter, the October 2015 VA examiner's medical opinion is legally inadequate.  VA regulations provide that a disability need not be diagnosed during service for service connection to be granted.  See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.303 (2015).  Absent further explanation, a statement that a disability is not due to service simply because it was not shown during service is legally inadequate.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007); see also Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (holding that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).  Moreover, the examiner's opinion did not substantially comply with the Board's July 2015 directives.  Specifically, the examiner was asked to opine as to whether the Veteran's hypertension had its onset during or is otherwise medically-related to a period of active duty service or a verified period of ACDUTRA.  While the examiner noted that the Veteran first developed hypertension in 2011, the examiner discussed the negative relationship between the Veteran's current hypertension and his military service as a whole and did not distinguish between his periods of active duty service and ACDUTRA service which ended in November 2012.  Likewise, the examiner ignored the Board's instructions to discuss all pertinent in- and post-service medical and other objective evidence, as well as all lay assertions.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the directives of its July 2015 remand have not yet been accomplished.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 105   (2008); Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999).\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the RO/Appeals Management Center (AMC) must obtain an appropriate supplemental medical opinion addressing whether there is a relationship between the Veteran's hypertension and his military service, including his periods of active duty and ACDUTRA service.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this case is REMANDED to the RO or the AMC, in Washington, D.C., for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  The RO/AMC must obtain an appropriate VA supplemental medical opinion by an examiner with sufficient expertise to address whether there is a relationship between the Veteran's hypertension and his military service. \r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the evidence of record, including the Veteran's statements, the examiner must opine as to whether there is a 50 percent or better probability that the Veteran's current hypertension had its onset during or is otherwise medically-related to a period of active duty service or a verified period of ACDUTRA.  The examiner is reminded that a statement that a disability is not due to service simply because it was not shown during service is legally inadequate.    \r\n\r\nIn addressing the questions above, the examiner must consider and discuss all pertinent in- and post-service medical and other objective evidence, as well as all lay assertions.\r\n \r\nThe supporting rationale for the opinion must also be provided.  If the examiner is unable to provide any required opinion, he or she should explain why.  If an opinion cannot be provided without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner shall provide a complete explanation as to why this is so.  If the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, the examiner should identify the additional information that is needed.\r\n\r\n2.  After completing the above action, and any other development indicated by any response received as a consequence of the actions taken in the paragraph above, the RO/AMC must readjudicate the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension.  If the benefit sought on appeal is not granted to the Veteran's satisfaction, the RO/AMC must provide the Veteran with a Supplemental Statement of the Case and an appropriate opportunity to respond, before the case is returned to the Board.\r\n\r\nBy this remand, the Board intimates no opinion as to any final outcome warranted. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran need take no action until he is otherwise notified, but he may furnish additional evidence and/or argument during the appropriate time frame.  See Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis REMAND must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or the Court for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Lopez, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2015).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1980 to April 1986.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) at a hearing held at the RO in May 2013.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThis case was previously before the Board in May 2014 and October 2015.  In October 2015, the Board remanded the issue of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability for additional development.  The October 2015 Board decision also denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  The Veteran has not appealed this decision.  Therefore, that issue is no longer in appellate status.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a remand is again required in this case.  The Board sincerely regrets the additional delay, which is necessary to ensure that there is a complete record upon which to decide the appellant's claim so that he is afforded every possible consideration.  VA has a duty to make reasonable efforts to assist the claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claim for the benefit sought, unless no reasonable possibility exists that such assistance would aid in substantiating the claim.  38 U.S .C.A. \ufffd 5103A(a) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c), (d) (2015).\r\n\r\nIn the interest of clarity, the Board will summarize the relevant development conducted up to this point.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran underwent a VA psychiatric examination in July 2010.  The examiner diagnosed major depressive disorder and concluded that she could not opine as to the etiology of the depression without resort to mere speculation.  \r\n\r\nIn May 2014, the Board determined that the July 2010 VA examination focused only on the specific stressor event identified by the Veteran (i.e., having served in funeral detail), rather than a complete analysis of direct service connection.  Accordingly, the Board remanded for a new VA examination.\r\n\r\nA second VA psychiatric examination was conducted in August 2014.  In a November 2014 addendum opinion, the VA examiner provided a diagnosis of alcohol-induced depressive disorder and opined that such disorder was not related to service, but rather to excessive alcohol use.  \r\n\r\nIn October 2015, the Board determined that the November 2014 VA opinion was inadequate because it did not specifically address the lay statements offered by the Veteran and others with regard to symptoms manifested in service and since service.  As a result, the Board remanded for a new VA examination and opinion.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the October 2015 Board remand, the Veteran underwent a third VA examination in December 2015.  The examiner determined that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  The examiner further indicated that she could not ethically provide a diagnosis due to significant concerns regarding the credibility of the Veteran's self-reported psychological symptoms.  She added that the provision of any diagnosis within the context of the Veteran's objective psychological testing results and inconsistent self-report would be unethical and require her to resort to mere speculation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the December 2015 VA examination, the Veteran submitted a January 2016 statement to clarify the scope of his appeal.  He indicated that he is seeking service connection for major depression and anxiety.  With regard to PTSD, he stated that he previously withdrew that aspect of the claim.  Based on this, he questioned the adequacy of the December 2015 VA examination, insofar as it focused only on the issue of PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that an addendum opinion is necessary.  As stated above, the December 2015 VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the criteria for PTSD and refused to provide an alternate diagnosis due to ethical considerations and because it would require her to resort to mere speculation.  The examiner, however, did not address the fact that VA treatment records, as well as the two prior VA examinations, show diagnoses of major depressive disorder and anxiety.  Further, she did not provide an opinion as to whether these are related to service.  As such, an adequate opinion is not of record.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c).  Expedited handling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  Forward the claims file, including a copy of this remand, to the examiner who conducted the December 2015 VA opinion, or another examiner if that individual is not available, to provide an addendum opinion.  (A full VA examination should not be scheduled unless it is deemed necessary by the examiner or otherwise required by the evidence.)  Review of the claims file should be noted by the examiner.\r\n\r\nThe examiner should respond to the following:\r\n\r\nIs there at least a 50 percent probability or greater (at least as likely as not) that the Veteran has a mental health disability, to include depression and anxiety?\r\n\r\nIf there is no currently diagnosed mental health disability, the examiner must reconcile this lack of diagnosis with VA treatment records showing diagnoses of major depressive disorder and anxiety, and specifically provide an opinion as to whether it is as likely as not that the Veteran had a mental health disability at any time since March 2010 even if that disability has since resolved.\r\n\r\nFor any mental health disability which the examiner finds to have been present at any time since March 2010, the examiner is asked to provide an opinion as to whether there is at least a 50 percent probability or greater (at least as likely as not) that is related to service.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must consider lay statements from the Veteran, to include his assertion that he went through a period of depression during a period in which he served on funeral detail and that he has had symptoms of depression since then.  See April 2010 statement from Veteran and supporting statements from fellow service member.  Please also consider the Veteran's contention that his mental health disability is related to service in Korea along the DMZ.  See March 2011 substantive appeal. \r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide a comprehensive rationale for any opinion offered.  This rationale must show adequate consideration of all pertinent lay or medical evidence.  If an opinion cannot be offered without resort to speculation, he or she should explain why and state what additional evidence, if any, would be required to offer an opinion.\r\n\r\n2.  Thereafter, readjudicate the issues on appeal.  If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, issue a supplemental statement of the case before returning the case to the Board, if otherwise in order.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.

Hal Smith,Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from June 2007 to March 2011.  \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2012 rating decision of the San Diego, California, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Jurisdiction of the claims file is now with the Waco, Texas, RO.  \r\n\r\nThis matter was previously before the Board in November 2014, and at that time the Board denied the Veteran's claim for an initial compensable rating for her left ear hearing loss.  The Veteran appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In June 2015, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) and vacated the portion of the November 2014 decision that denied entitlement to an extraschedular referral and remanded that matter for further development.  In July 2015, the Board remanded the claim primarily for referral to the Director of Compensation Service pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.321(b) (2015).  The claim has now been returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  Accordingly, any future consideration of this appellant's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.  In addition to the VBMS file, there is a Virtual VA paperless claims file associated with the Veteran's claim.  \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required on her part.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, and for reasons explained below, in order to comply with the legal duty to assist the Veteran, the Board finds that it must once again remand the claim for additional development action.  \r\n\r\nIn the JMPR, it was noted that the Board had failed to address the Veteran's symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and headaches as reported in an August 2010 examination.  Review of the service treatment records (STRs) reflects that July 2010 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left ear showed normal appearance of the apparatus.  There was no evidence of acute intracranial process.  In August 2010, it was noted that the Veteran's history included not only hearing loss, but also dizziness, nausea, and headaches.  Review of the post service treatment records is negative for further mention of these symptoms (other than intermittent headaches associated with a cold in January 2014), to include upon VA audiometric examination in March 2011.  The February 2016 report provided by the Director of Compensation Service does not discuss the symptoms of dizziness, headaches, or nausea.  \r\n\r\nIn a June 2016 brief, the Veteran's representative pointed to the JMPR and argued that the Board did not address the Veteran's symptoms of dizziness, headaches, and nausea.  As the record stands, it is unclear as to whether the Veteran is claiming service connection for these symptoms as secondary to her service-connected left ear hearing loss or on a direct basis.  Thus, clarification is necessary, and the Veteran should be advised that she may file a claim for service connection for these symptoms/disorders.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, additional VA examinations are necessary to address the medical questions raised.  The law provides that VA shall make reasonable efforts to notify a claimant of the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim and requires VA to assist a claimant in obtaining that evidence.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2015).  Such assistance includes assisting the claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claim for the benefit sought, and providing the claimant a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on a claim.  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd\ufffd 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159 (2015).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Initially, as stated above, the AOJ/RO should advise the Veteran that if she is claiming service connection for current dizziness, nausea, and headaches, either on a direct basis or as secondary to service-connected left ear hearing loss, such a claim or claims should be filed.  \r\n\r\n2.  Obtain any outstanding and relevant VA or private treatment records (obtaining authorization from the Veteran as required), clearly document any response received, and associate any such records with the claims file.  \r\n\r\n3.  Then, regardless of whether the Veteran files supplemental claims or not, arrange for her to undergo an audiometric examination and physical examination by a suitably qualified examiner.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's complaints of dizziness, nausea, and headaches, the examiner should render an opinion, consistent with sound medical principles, as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., a 50 percent or greater probability) that such symptoms, if present,\r\n\r\na. had their onset in or are otherwise medically-related to service, to include symptoms allegedly experienced during service; or, if not, \r\n\r\nb. were caused OR aggravated (worsened beyond natural progression) by hearing loss. \r\n\r\nIn providing the requested opinions, the examiner must consider and discuss all pertinent medical and other objective evidence, as well as all lay assertions, to include the following:\r\n\r\na. the negative MRI of the left ear in July 2010.  \r\n\r\nb. the August 2010 report of hearing loss as well as complaints of dizziness, nausea, and headaches. \r\n\r\nc. post service records which are negative for further complaints of these symptoms, to include at time of March 2011 audiometric examination. \r\n\r\nIf the examiner finds that dizziness, headaches, and/or nausea are related to service-connected left ear hearing loss, he/she should comment on the Veteran's functional impairment with respect to her activities of daily living and the effect on her employment (earning capacity) and daily life.  He/she should also comment on the combined effects of the service-connected disabilities (lumbosacral spine, tinnitus, left ear hearing loss) on the Veteran's ability to engage in any type of full-time employment.  \r\n\r\nThe examiner must provide a rationale for any opinion proffered.  \r\n\r\n4.  Note: The Veteran is to be advised that failure to report for a scheduled VA examination without good cause shown may have adverse effects on her claim.  38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.655 (2015).  Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant or the death of an immediate family member.  If the Veteran fails to report to the scheduled examination, the AOJ/RO should obtain and associate with the claims file a copy or copies of the notice or notices of examination sent to the appellant by the appropriate VA medical facility.  \r\n\r\n5.  After the above development has been completed, review all the evidence of record and readjudicate the issue of entitlement to an extraschedular rating for left ear hearing loss.  If this issue remains denied, provide the Veteran and representative with a supplemental statement of the case.  An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  \r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Kung, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to June 1969.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2013 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Chicago, Illinois (RO).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran provided testimony at an August 2015 Board videoconference hearing, the hearing transcript is of record.  \r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.900(c) (2016).  38 U.S.C.A. \ufffd 7107(a)(2) (West 2015).\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board has obtained a medical specialist's opinions from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in conjunction with the Veteran's appeal and has associated them with the record.  In a July 2016 letter, the Board provided a copy of these opinions to the Veteran, offered him an opportunity to submit additional evidence or argument in support of his claim, and informed him that he had the option to having any newly submitted evidence considered by the AOJ.  \r\n\r\nIn August 2016, the Veteran submitted additional evidence, arguments, and statements in support of his claim, and requested that his case be remanded to the AOJ for consideration of this new evidence in the first instance.  Thus, the case is being remanded to the AOJ for initial consideration of the claim in light of the new evidence.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\nThe AOJ should review the case again based on the additional evidence and argument submitted by the Veteran's in August 2016 along with all the evidence of record.  If the benefits sought are not granted, the AOJ should furnish the Veteran and his representative with a Supplemental Statement of the Case, and should give the Veteran a reasonable opportunity to respond before returning the record to the Board for further review. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.

Kovarovic, Associate Counsel \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1966 to October 1967.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2010 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Atlanta, Georgia. \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran initially filed a claim to establish service connection for PTSD. However, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the scope of a claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the veteran's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and additional information submitted or developed in support of the claim. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (finding a claimant without medical expertise cannot be expected to precisely delineate the diagnosis of his mental illness). In light of this determination and the evidence of record, the Board has expanded the Veteran's claim to include all acquired psychiatric disabilities, and the issue has been re-characterized as stated on the title page.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Veteran's substantive appeal dated December 2011 included a request for a travel board hearing. The Veteran subsequently withdrew this request in October 2012. See 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 20.704(e) (2015).\r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) was raised by the Veteran in a June 2016 claim, but has not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over it, and it is referred to the AOJ for appropriate action. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 19.9(b) (2015). \r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ. VA will notify the Veteran if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran is seeking entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability. Although the Board sincerely regrets the additional delay this may cause, further development is necessary prior to adjudication of this claim.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the Veteran underwent VA psychiatric examinations in October 2010 and September 2011. However, the Board finds that these examinations are inadequate for the purpose of adjudicating this claim, as neither examiner addressed the possible causal relationship between the Veteran's current psychiatric disability and his military service. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (stating that when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).\r\n\r\nGenerally, VA must provide an examination when the evidence shows: (1) A current disability; (2) an in-service event, injury, or disease; (3) some indication that the claimed disability may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease, and (4) insufficient competent evidence of record for VA to make a decision. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). With regard to the third element, the Court has established a low threshold and requires only that the evidence indicates that there may be a nexus between the two.\r\n\r\nHere, the October 2010 and September 2011 VA examinations, coupled with the Veteran's VA treatment records, provide evidence of a current psychiatric disability. The Veteran has repeatedly asserted that this disability is causally related to his verified combat service in Vietnam. However, no VA examiner has ever addressed the possible nexus between the Veteran's combat experience and his current psychiatric disability. As such, the Veteran should be scheduled for a new VA examination to fully assess the existence and etiology of his acquired psychiatric disability. Id.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the RO should also associate ongoing pertinent VA treatment reports with the record before the Board. 38 C.F.R. \ufffd 3.159(c) (2).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain and associate with the record all VA treatment records for the Veteran dated December 2014 to the present. All actions to obtain the requested records should be fully documented in the record. If they cannot be located or no such records exist, the Veteran and his representative should be so notified in writing.\r\n\r\n2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA psychiatric examination to determine whether any current psychiatric disability is related to service. The claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to the examiner for review in connection with the examination. All pertinent symptomatology and findings must be reported in detail. The examiner must record all pertinent medical complaints, symptoms, and clinical findings, and must review the results of any testing prior to completion of the report. Following a review of the claims file, to include service and post-service medical records, and the examination results, the examiner should then address the following:\r\n\r\n      a. Identify all applicable psychiatric disabilities. \r\n\r\nIn making this determination, the examiner should determine whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD based on the applicable DSM criteria and, if any such criteria are not adequately met for a diagnosis of PTSD, the examiner must explain, in detail, why they are not. The examiner must reconcile his/her finding as to a diagnosis of PTSD with the reported diagnoses of PTSD per DSM guidelines in the VA treatment reports.\r\n b. If the Veteran is diagnosed with PTSD, the examiner should state whether the Veteran's reported combat stressor(s) are sufficient to have caused PTSD, and offer an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the stressor(s) caused the Veteran's PTSD. Such reported stressors include: exposure to accidental gunfire from a malfunctioning M14 during a foxhole training exercise; transport into Vietnam on a troop carrier plane; assisting with cleanup after a fellow convoy was hit by a mortar round; and repeated assignment to guard duty, including one occasion when the Veteran was assigned an M60 upon his belief that an enemy soldier was nearby.  \r\n\r\nc. If the Veteran is diagnosed with a psychiatric disability other than PTSD, the examiner is requested to offer an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or more) that the psychiatric disability began in service, was caused by service, or is otherwise related to service.\r\n\r\nA complete rationale must be provided for all opinions.\r\n\r\nIf the Veteran fails to report for the examination, the examiner should nevertheless undertake a review of the claims file and respond to the above questions.\r\n\r\n3. Thereafter, the RO should readjudicate the issue on appeal. If the benefit sought is not granted, issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case and afford the Veteran and his representative an appropriate opportunity to respond. The case should then be returned to the Board as warranted.\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded. Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment. The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.
